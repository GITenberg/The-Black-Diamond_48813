<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>The
First Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Abner Fellows</span> was born in the front
bedroom of Number Eleven Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages, a four-roomed
house of old brickwork that stood in the middle of a row of
twenty-one, set diagonally across a patch of waste land on the
outskirts of Halesby.&nbsp; The terrace was fifty years old, and
looked older, for the smoke and coal dust of the neighbouring
pits had corroded the surface of the bricks, while the
&lsquo;crowning in&rsquo; of the earth&rsquo;s crust above the
gigantic burrowings of the Great Mawne Colliery had loosened the
mortar between them and even produced a series of long cracks
that clove the house-walls from top to bottom like conventional
forked lightning.&nbsp; One of these lines of cleavage split the
face of Number Eleven and ran through the middle of a plaster
plaque on which the pious owner of the cottages had carved the
words:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>ISAIAH HACKETT</i>:<br />
<i>GLORY BE TO GOD</i>, <i>1839</i>.</p>
<p>This plaque, together with the metal medallion of a fire
insurance corporation and two iron bosses connected with the
system of stays by which Mr Hackett&rsquo;s descendants had tried
to save their property from collapsing, made the Fellows&rsquo;s
house the most decorative feature of the row, and gave Abner a
feeling of enviable distinction in his childhood long before he
knew what they meant.</p>
<p>His father, John Fellows, like the rest of the tenants, was a
miner.&nbsp; He had chosen to live in Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages
because they lay nearer to the colliery than any other buildings
in Halesby and were within a reasonable distance of the
cross-roads where stood his favourite public-house, the Lyttleton
Arms.&nbsp; Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages, in fact, hung poised, as it
were, between two magnetic poles: the pit where the money was
earned and the pub where it was spent.&nbsp; To remain there <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>contented would
have implied a nice equilibrium, had it not been that eastward of
the cross-roads and the Lyttleton Arms ran the Stourton Road,
with houses on both sides of it, and amongst them the Lord
Nelson, the Greyhound, and the Royal Oak.&nbsp; Next to the Royal
Oak came the entrance of the Mawne United football ground, and
since John Fellows&rsquo;s passion for football was only exceeded
by his devotion to &lsquo;four-penny,&rsquo; the pull of the
colliery was hopelessly overbalanced by these delights.</p>
<p>At the side of the Royal Oak, on Saturday afternoons, the
entrance to the football ground swarmed with black coats; and the
crowd of small boys, of whom Abner made one, peering through
cracks in the match-board palings could see nothing but the backs
of other black coats, or perhaps, above the tilted heads of the
spectators, the sphere of a football leaping gaily into the
dreary gray that passes for heaven in a black-country
winter.&nbsp; It cost threepence (ladies and children half-price)
to enter the football ground, and since John Fellows never wasted
the price of a pint on any one but himself, Abner had to be
content with an occasional sight of the football soaring above
this or that quarter of the field of play and with the hoarse
waves of encouragement or derision that went up from the crowd
inside.</p>
<p>Later, in the happy days before his father&rsquo;s second
marriage and the second family, John Fellows used to take the boy
along with him to the football field on Saturday afternoons, or
rather Abner would trail behind him as far as the gate and then
pass through the turnstile in front of him, wedged between his
father&rsquo;s trousers and those of the man in front, breathing
perpetually the acrid smell of oily coal-dust which he accepted
as the natural odour of humanity.&nbsp; Whenever he could get
himself washed in time John Fellows made a point of going early
to the ground so that he might place himself in his favourite
position, immediately behind the nearer goal-posts, so close to
the net that he could talk with George Harper, the Mawne United
goalkeeper, who, before this translation, had been a collier
working in the same shift as himself, or <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>under-mine the
self-possession of the visiting &lsquo;custodian&rsquo; with
jeers and abuse.</p>
<p>Even at these close quarters, where Abner felt the pressure of
his father&rsquo;s protecting legs and heard him spitting into
the net over his head, there was no conversation between
them.&nbsp; John Fellows kept his speech for his mates, for
George Harper, or, on occasion, for the referee; but at
half-time, when most of the players ran in to the pavilion and
the ball was free, he would give Abner a poke in the back and his
neighbours a wink, and the lad would slip under the wire roping
and plunge into the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of boys who were
scrambling for its possession.&nbsp; Once Abner had dribbled the
ball away from the others and sent a shot at the goal which
George Harper, who had stayed behind talking, moved mechanically
to stop, and missed; a ripple of laughter had spread round the
field, and when Abner ran back under the ropes with his face
flaming, his father pulled him in by the ear and said with his
clay pipe between his teeth: &lsquo;Damn&rsquo; little blood-worm
yo&rsquo; are!&nbsp; Bain&rsquo;t he, George?&rsquo;&nbsp; And
George Harper, staring down at him with his big, melancholy eyes,
said, &lsquo;Ah . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day, as a reward for his prowess, John Fellows took Abner
with him on his afternoon walk, past the cherry orchard, past the
stationary cages at the pithead and the silent engine-house of
the Great Mawne Colliery, down between the smoking spoil-banks to
the bridge over the Stour which separates the two counties of
Worcester and Stafford, in either of which the police of the
other are providentially powerless.&nbsp; Here, on a cinder
pathway shaded by the sooty chestnuts of Mawne Hall, there was
racing between the limber fawn-skinned whippets that the miners
fancy: timid, quivering creatures, with their slim waists bound
in flannel jackets like frail women in their stays.&nbsp; It was
thrilling to watch them slip from the leash, race with their
pointed heads converging, and roll over at the finish in a cloud
of cinder-dust.</p>
<p>On that Sunday the police of Staffordshire were
quiescent.&nbsp; George Harper was there, his massive thighs
bulging striped cashmere trousers.&nbsp; There was joking between
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>George and
Abner&rsquo;s father about the goal that the boy had
kicked.&nbsp; John Fellows won five shillings on a dog called
Daisy, and Abner trailed home behind him at six o&rsquo;clock,
when the steam in the engine-house was beginning to hiss from its
exhaust in preparation for Monday&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; John
Fellows retired to the Lyttleton Arms with his five shillings and
spent a dozen more, while Abner went home, too tired to play and
clammed for his tea.&nbsp; It surprised him to find number eleven
locked up, though he ought to have remembered that before they
went out dog-racing his father had left the key with Mrs Moseley,
who did the housework, and cooked their dinner; but when he
walked round to Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s he found that she had gone to
church and forgotten to take the key out of her pocket.&nbsp; He
tramped back home again and fell asleep on the doorstep.</p>
<p>In later years, when the conflict with his father began, he
always remembered these untroubled days with regrets: the
Saturday football matches; the Sunday whippet-racing and
terrier-fighting, together with certain afternoon walks along the
tow-path of the canal, where the bodies of puppies that were old
enough to be taxed floated into beds of loose-strife and
willow-weed, and jack-bannocks hung swimming in shoals through
the yellow water.&nbsp; In all these memories John Fellows was a
benignant figure; and this one would hardly have guessed, for
John Fellows was not prepossessing.&nbsp; He was a short man with
a low-set head and an immense shoulder-girdle.&nbsp; His eyes
were small and lost in deep orbits, so that when his face was
ingrained with carbon the white of the sclerotics was intensified
in a way that made them seem grudging and malignant.&nbsp;
Walking home in his pit clothes, bow-legged and with the dazed
and hampered gait which is the mark of men who labour
underground, he always looked as if he had been drinking.&nbsp;
Generally he <i>had</i> been drinking, but at his soberest he was
an ugly customer, and the blue enamelled tin pot in which he
carried his tea struck one as a dangerous weapon.</p>
<p>Poverty their household never knew.&nbsp; John Fellows could
reckon on picking up his three pounds a week, and spent every
penny of it.&nbsp; There was always meat <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>in the house,
and Mrs Moseley knew better than to serve him with food that was
not freshly cooked.&nbsp; In his way he was an epicure.&nbsp;
Although the Lyttleton Arms was the nearest public-house, Abner
would often be sent out with a jug to fetch his father&rsquo;s
supper beer from the Greyhound, or even from the Royal Oak, next
the football ground, where they kept Astill&rsquo;s Guaranteed
Old Stingo.&nbsp; John Fellows had no use for bottled beer.&nbsp;
Bottled belly-ache, he called it.&nbsp; He rarely smoked a pipe,
for lights were forbidden in the pit, and the habit of chewing
plug-tobacco had made him prefer his nicotine neat.</p>
<p>He was shaved once a week, on Saturday nights, and upon this
function depended another of Abner&rsquo;s special joys: the
privilege of going with him to the barber&rsquo;s shop, a low,
boarded room heated by gas-jets and the breath of expectant,
expectorant men.&nbsp; Here, wedged upon a bench at his
father&rsquo;s side, he would read the comic papers that Mr Evans
provided for his customers.&nbsp; Some were printed on pink paper
and some on green; and while Abner absorbed the adventures of two
alliterative tramps, he would hear the sing-song of Mr Evans, a
Welshman from some remote Radnorshire village, as he talked to
the victim of his razor and the other waiting customers.&nbsp; Mr
Evans was a great authority on local football, and subscribed to
a news-agency that sent him a sheet of half-time and final scores
long before the evening edition of the <i>North Bromwich
Argus</i> arrived.&nbsp; His knowledge of football politics and
personalities was all the more remarkable because Saturday was
his busiest day, and for that reason he could never see a game of
football played.&nbsp; Abner envied him this abstract knowledge
of the game; but more than Mr Evans he envied a small boy with
pink face and plastered hair who, wearing a long white jacket,
lathered the customers&rsquo; chins, and when Mr Evans had
scraped them, sprayed their faces with bay-rum.&nbsp; At last,
with dramatic suddenness, this entertainment was withdrawn.&nbsp;
John Fellows developed a rash on his chin which Mr Ingleby, the
chemist, declared to be barber&rsquo;s itch, and Mr Evans became
the object of his most particular hatred.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&lsquo;That bloody Welshman!&rsquo; said John
Fellows.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon shaving&rsquo;s a dirty
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so he grew a beard . . . but he wouldn&rsquo;t let that
Evans trim it, not he!</p>
<p>All Abner&rsquo;s early pleasures were in some way or other
related to his father.&nbsp; It was natural that John Fellows
should take a pride in his only child.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t talk
to him much&mdash;a man who chews tobacco has better work for his
jaws than talking&mdash;but he was sometimes amused by his
company and proud of his sturdiness and capacity for
mischief.&nbsp; He rejoiced that his son was a
&lsquo;bloodworm&rsquo; much in the same way as his mates
rejoiced that their terriers were good fighters.&nbsp; He liked
him to be hard, and boasted that Abner could take the strap (as
he called it) without yelling.&nbsp; Indeed there was something
to boast about in this, for the miner chastened his son with a
brown leather belt which, as the buckle witnessed, had once
belonged to a member of the South Staffordshire Regiment.&nbsp;
This belt, he sometimes affirmed, had been all round the world
before it came into his possession; but Abner was too well
acquainted with its other qualities to pursue the history of
this.</p>
<p>In spite of his weekly lickings Abner&rsquo;s life was
generally happy.&nbsp; He had no cares for the future.&nbsp; He
knew that when his schooling was over he would be sent to work at
the pit.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t be sorry for that, for it seemed
to him quite natural to work underground, to earn big money and
spend it freely.&nbsp; When that day came he felt that he and his
father would be able to drink together on equal terms.&nbsp; By
the time that he was fourteen he was already taller than John
Fellows, and meant to grow a lot taller still.&nbsp; He was going
to be strong and to learn boxing: perhaps, in a few years&rsquo;
time, he would be able to strip and fight in one of the
boxing-booths at the wakes: perhaps, in stripes of chocolate and
yellow, he might even play football for Mawne United and talk
like a brother with the great George Harper.</p>
<p>In this manly, indefinite future, women had no place.&nbsp; He
had never had a sister; as far as he remembered he had never had
a mother; and so he followed the <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>example of his father whose
domineering attitude towards the widow, Mrs Moseley, was beyond
any doubt correct, while Mrs Moseley, who had her living to make,
accepted it without protest, as a woman should do.&nbsp; Towards
girls themselves Abner felt no positive hostility, though he
passed them in the street as a well-mannered dog passes cats,
with a solid appreciation of their potential evil; but for
members of his own sex who dallied with emasculating tendernesses
he and the boys with whom he played were full of scorn and even
of active malice.&nbsp; The worst libel that any of his
companions could suffer was a chalk inscription on his own back
door of the words: &lsquo;Tommy So-and-so goes with Cissy
Something-else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner and his friends even went so far as to pester these
votaries of passion in their own most sheltered haunts.&nbsp;
Above the pithead of the Great Mawne Colliery runs a lane
skirting the ancient cherry orchard of Old Mawne Hall.&nbsp; It
is short: at the end of it the pit-mound stands up black, and
over beyond the Stour valley a desert of blackness stretches
westward, with smoke-stacks thronging thick as masts of shipping
in a harbour.&nbsp; Over its hedges, in the dusk, light clouds of
cherry-blossom may be seen, but even before the wind has tumbled
the petals down they are blackened by smuts from the colliery
chimney.&nbsp; This lane, indeed, was a decorous walking place
where one might hear a patter of moving feet and low laughter on
any evening in May; but lower down the slope, past the colliery,
it turned into another, shadowed with hot-smelling elder, stunted
hawthorns and oak-apple trees, which had a darker
reputation.&nbsp; Dipping down over the hillside this lane climbs
back upon itself and opens out again into the orchard road.&nbsp;
This loop, which is called in Halesby the &lsquo;Dark
Half-hour,&rsquo; was the favourite hunting ground for Abner and
his friends.&nbsp; Carrying the smelly dark-lanterns that are
sold on Guy Fawkes&rsquo; day, they would creep as quietly as
possible under the shadows of the trees, selecting at a signalled
moment some unfortunate couple locked in each other&rsquo;s arms
whom they might shame with their lights.&nbsp; Often they got
their heads smacked, but this only served to reinforce <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>their opinion
that lovemaking which shrank from publicity was
discreditable.</p>
<p>One evening in summer when Abner was fourteen he took part in
one of these expeditions.&nbsp; The day had been hot.&nbsp; His
father had promised him that he would make him a kite in the
evening.&nbsp; The split lath lay ready on the table with a roll
of blue paper.&nbsp; Mrs Moseley had boiled some paste, and Abner
had borrowed enough string and folded newspaper to make a
tail.&nbsp; As the heat of the afternoon declined a gusty wind
began to blow from the west, filling the street with dust and
scraps of paper.&nbsp; At six o&rsquo;clock John Fellows came
back from the pit.&nbsp; The dust had blown into his eyes, that
were never very strong.&nbsp; Tears and sweat together were
tracking down through the grime on his cheeks.&nbsp; He seemed to
have forgotten all about Abner&rsquo;s kite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he cried, irritably.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; give us a moment&rsquo;s
peace?&nbsp; Wait till I&rsquo;ve swilled!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had his swill in the brewhouse, filling a tin bath with
black soap-suds.&nbsp; The kite had become a grievance.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nattering away . . .&rsquo; he muttered, with his head in
a roller towel, &lsquo;werriting about kites on a day that would
make a pig sweat blood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner, who knew his father, got away without any further
discussion, leaving Mrs Moseley to soothe him.&nbsp; He went out
and played cricket in the sloping field above the pit where the
ponies that have worked so long underground that they are blind
are put out to green grass and to a white mockery that they get
to know as daylight.&nbsp; When the boys came down to play, these
shaggy creatures stood huddled in a corner and edged against one
another, rubbing the coal-dust out of their matted coats.&nbsp;
If they strayed over the field of play Abner and his friends
pelted them with pieces of slag from the cinder heap behind the
wickets.&nbsp; They also threw slag at a group of little girls
who dared to look at them over the broken hedge.&nbsp; When the
light faded so much that they could no longer see to play, and
the beam-engine in the power-house ceased to grunt, the boys all
lay down talking in the hedgerow, and the ponies wandered back to
pull at the grass on either side of the pitch.&nbsp; At last
Abner, who was the leader of the set, <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>because he was the strongest, said:
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go down the Dark Half-hour and scare some of
&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On such a clammy evening there were certain to be many
lovers.&nbsp; One of the boys produced a halfpenny packet of red
Bengal-lights.&nbsp; Abner snatched them from him, left him
crying, and with three others ran down to the mouth of the
lane.&nbsp; In the hedge-side couples stirred uneasily.&nbsp; The
tunnel under the elders was full of a hot odour of dust and
nettles and some kind of mint.&nbsp; They crept forward through
the darkness in Indian file.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s try this
one, kid,&rsquo; whispered a boy named Hodgetts, &lsquo;him over
there up agen&rsquo; the tree.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere, where&rsquo;s
the bloody box?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s somebody coming,&rsquo; whispered a
woman&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>They struck three lights together.&nbsp; The tunnel glowed
like a furnace.&nbsp; Against the trunk of a tree a short man was
leaning with a pale young woman clutched in his arms.&nbsp; Abner
saw that it was his father.&nbsp; He dropped his match and
ran.</p>
<p>The boy Hodgetts came panting behind him.&nbsp; He was
shouting: &lsquo;Kid . . . kid . . . did yo&rsquo; see who he
were?&nbsp; It were your gaffer!&rsquo;&nbsp; Abner turned and
swiped at him viciously as he ran.&nbsp; Joe Hodgetts crumpled up
in the hedge howling.&nbsp; Abner went on blindly into the Cherry
Orchard Road.&nbsp; His heart thudded in his throat like a
water-hammer.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know where he was.&nbsp; He
only knew that he was crying and that he had broken his knuckles
on Joe Hodgett&rsquo;s skull.&nbsp; He rubbed them in the black
dust of the roadway, and that stopped the bleeding.&nbsp; But
nothing, it seemed, could stop his tears.</p>
<h2><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>The
Second Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he reached home, half an hour
later, he was ashamed of himself.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter to
him what his father did.&nbsp; He only hoped that John Fellows
hadn&rsquo;t recognised him, for that would make him sure of a
belting.&nbsp; Still, he was glad that he had given Joe Hodgetts
what for.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t going to have a fellow of his own
age laughing at his father even if his father had let him down by
making a fool of himself.</p>
<p>A year later John Fellows was married.&nbsp; In spite of
Abner&rsquo;s scorn the proceeding was natural enough.&nbsp; The
man was under forty, and had been a widower for more than
fourteen years.&nbsp; The new wife, the woman of the tunnel, was
a girl named Alice Higgins, the elder daughter of an old friend
of Fellows, the timekeeper at the colliery, who had lost his left
leg many years ago in a crushing fall of coal.&nbsp; She was
tall, slight, with a fair complexion and honey-coloured hair: in
every physical particular the opposite of her swart and stubby
husband.&nbsp; If such a thing had to be, Abner would have
preferred the maturer charms of Mrs Moseley, whom he knew so well
and liked, to those of any stranger.&nbsp; Indeed, from the day
of his father&rsquo;s marriage onward his life became more
complicated.</p>
<p>The very presence in the house of this new inmate, a woman
wielding authority, whom he remembered only a little time ago as
a girl with a pigtail down her back, made him awkward.&nbsp; His
father had never even mentioned their meeting in the
lane&mdash;probably he had not recognised Abner, but the boy was
certain that Alice had seen him and remembered.&nbsp; The
consciousness of this mystery that they shared only aggravated
the distrust and shyness that separated them: a shyness which
Alice herself honestly tried to overcome by little overtures of
affection.&nbsp; She was quite determined, in her quiet way, that
she wasn&rsquo;t going to be like the stepmothers of
tradition.&nbsp; She would try to be a real mother to
Abner.&nbsp; But how did real mothers feel?</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you call me mother, like other
boys would, Abner?&rsquo; she said one day, coaxingly.&nbsp;
Abner only laughed.&nbsp; She hated him for laughing at
her.&nbsp; A boy of his age!</p>
<p>But the real trouble did not begin till a year later when the
first baby of the new family was coming.&nbsp; It was a bad time
for all of them.&nbsp; John Fellows, after fifteen years of a
widower&rsquo;s life, had forgotten anything that he had ever
learnt in the way of matrimonial tactics.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t
any longer a young man, and his nature had inevitably
stiffened.&nbsp; Besides, the coming of this child was not like
the adventure of Abner&rsquo;s birth, when he and his first wife
had been two tender young people rather overwhelmed by the
responsibilities of marriage.&nbsp; Alice became more conscious
than ever of the gap of years that separated them, the distance
which had always been implicit in her idea of her father&rsquo;s
friend, &lsquo;Mr Fellows.&rsquo;&nbsp; With her it could never
be naturally &lsquo;John.&rsquo;&nbsp; And now that she wanted
somebody to take hold of her and share her fears she found
herself face to face with an elderly stranger.&nbsp; She was
frightened at the thought of being so utterly alone.&nbsp; Abner,
a member of her own generation, and the son of her baby&rsquo;s
father, was a symbol of the whole disastrous circumstance.</p>
<p>In spite of all her good resolutions she couldn&rsquo;t help
letting off a little of her unhappiness on him.&nbsp; It was
against her will that she did so.&nbsp; Sometimes she cried with
vexation at her own irritability and resolved to overcome
it.&nbsp; Then, as the months dragged on, she began to wonder if
it were worth while tiring herself out with good resolutions or
anything else in the world.&nbsp; She found herself becoming
wilfully vixenish with her husband.&nbsp; That didn&rsquo;t
matter, for she seldom saw him; but a little later a new emotion,
stronger and more positively devastating than any that she had
known before, seized her.&nbsp; It was a thing that she
couldn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; She felt as if some strange,
dark spirit had invaded and perverted her consciousness, making
her think madly and not in the least as she wanted to think,
filling her with a mixture of hate and jealousy towards
Abner.&nbsp; This passion would not let <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>her be.&nbsp;
However tired and jaded she were the fiend was ready to tear
her.&nbsp; She could not see the boy without hating him.&nbsp;
She felt just like a cat with kittens, who spits at the kittens
of another cat.</p>
<p>She had plenty of opportunities for showing her hatred.&nbsp;
Abner was now fifteen.&nbsp; His schooling was finished, and he
had begun to work at the colliery, leading the ponies that drag
trollies of coal along the galleries of the pit.&nbsp; He found
it quite good fun.&nbsp; The pony of which he had charge was very
old and quite blind, for it had worked in Mawne pit since before
Abner was born.&nbsp; He found it slower than a pony should be
and spent the first Sunday after he had started work in searching
Uffdown Wood for an ash-plant with which he might induce the pony
to go faster.&nbsp; When he had found one he fitted a pin in the
end of it.</p>
<p>A few minutes after six every evening the cage would come
clanking up to the pit-head, and before it settled with a jerk,
Abner, black with coal-grime, would shoot out like a hare and go
whistling home to his tea.&nbsp; He whistled because there was
always a curious lightening of his heart at the change from the
murk of the pit to daylight.&nbsp; It was spring when he started
work.&nbsp; Every evening as he passed the cherry orchard he
heard the whistle of a blackbird poised on the topmost bough of
one of the foamy trees.&nbsp; He wondered exuberantly if he could
find its nest some day.&nbsp; He even collected a couple of
pebbles to put in the place of eggs.&nbsp; But when he got home
there was no Mrs Moseley, waiting with a &lsquo;piece&rsquo;
ready buttered and a cup of steaming tea&mdash;only Alice,
dragging about the kitchen, greeting him with jealous eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, you dirty little beast,&rsquo; she would say,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t you dare soil that table now.&nbsp; Mind your
filthy hands!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s summat to have your father, let
alone yo&rsquo;.&nbsp; Here, that&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s
towel.&nbsp; Loose it quick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>None of this was very serious, but it made a great difference
to Abner.&nbsp; He was continually being shocked to find that
small details in the arrangement of the house, such as the
position of a chair which had always been his favourite, were
being altered from day to day.&nbsp; Alice had a fever for making
freakish variations in the <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>kitchen furniture.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t be happy to see things in the same place for two
days running.&nbsp; She was never satisfied, making alterations,
as it seemed, simply for the sake of finding fresh work to do,
yet always working under protest.&nbsp; Her presence became
dragged and unhappy, and the only results of her unnatural
labours were untidiness and confusion.</p>
<p>Even John Fellows could not help being irritated by these
fruitless activities.&nbsp; His first wife, and later Mrs
Moseley, had known that it was as much as their lives were worth
not to have the house swept and speckless by evening ready to
receive the pit dirt of the master.&nbsp; Now, when he came home
to find Alice crouching over the fireplace in her bulged apron
smearing red raddle on the hearth without as much as a kettle
boiling, he would stand still in the doorway, a short, aggressive
figure, and ask the wench what she thought she was doing croodled
down there in the grate and him waiting for his tea.&nbsp; Then
Alice, with her pale face averted, would snarl back at him and
his dirt in the high-pitched voice in which she used to gossip
with Mrs Hobbs, three doors down.&nbsp; All the women in
Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages eventually developed the same sort of
voice.</p>
<p>John Fellows really behaved rather well.&nbsp; He knew that it
wasn&rsquo;t worth while grumbling, reflected that all women were
more than usually unreasonable at these times, and so he would
sometimes start his washing in the scullery with cold water,
knowing well that in a moment the little vixen would be at his
elbow with a boiling saucepan.&nbsp; Then he would catch hold of
her in his grimy arms, and she would cry out shrilly that he was
a great mucky beast and tell him to &lsquo;give
over.&rsquo;&nbsp; A little sparring of this kind often put him
in a good humour, and Alice, quick to recognise the peculiar
power which her physical presence still exercised on her husband,
sometimes presumed on it so far that these passages of arms ended
in tears.&nbsp; At such times it frightened her to see him
suddenly revealed to her as a strange, hard man, nearly double
her own age, with whom she was unaccountably living.&nbsp; Even
maternity couldn&rsquo;t make her feel anything but <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>a little girl
in the face of his strange maturity.&nbsp; She felt that John
Fellows knew, as well as she did, that she was only making
believe to be a grown-up married woman; he had shown it more than
once by his roughness to her; but that didn&rsquo;t really matter
as long as the neighbours never guessed her secret&mdash;the
neighbours, and more particularly Abner.&nbsp; For if Abner once
knew the truth she could never again be mistress in her own house
(that was how she put it) and she was so jealous of this
imaginary dignity, and at the same time so conscious of its
artificiality, that she could never cease trying to put Abner in
his place.</p>
<p>It was bad enough for Alice that her husband should laugh at
her.&nbsp; Certainly, she determined, she wasn&rsquo;t going to
stand anything of that kind from Abner; and though Abner himself
had not yet shown her any signs of disrespect she took great
pains to give him no opportunity of doing so by repressing him
whenever she had the chance.&nbsp; Just as John Fellows had once
approved in Abner the aggressive tendencies that went to the
making of a &lsquo;bloodworm,&rsquo; he now approved in Alice, so
little and so desperately game, the temper that made things so
uncomfortable for Abner.&nbsp; As long as she kept her temper for
the boy and didn&rsquo;t try any of her tricks on him it
didn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; And since it pleased John Fellows, who
loved nothing better than a dog-fight, to see his little Alice
bare her teeth, the girl played up to him, knowing that her
husband would keep Abner from hitting back as long as the game
pleased him.</p>
<p>Abner suffered her sullenly.&nbsp; He soon found out that it
wasn&rsquo;t worth while disputing with her, and indeed,
sometimes her violence, wasting itself against his unconcern,
recoiled on her, so that he had the satisfaction of seeing her in
tears.&nbsp; This vexed her, partly for shame and partly because
she saw that crying, which she had always regarded as her last
and most telling weapon, had no effect on him.&nbsp; They were
both of them little more than children.</p>
<p>In the end it came to this: Abner, realising that
Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages could never again be a real home to him,
decided, with the philosophy which is learned <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>early among
people who have to fight for themselves, that he must cut his
losses and strike out for himself as soon as he could manage to
do so.&nbsp; He knew that for the present he could not afford to
find another lodging, but already he was doing a man&rsquo;s work
at the colliery and soon he would be earning a man&rsquo;s
wages.&nbsp; When she realised this Alice was sorry that she had
helped to drive him away, for she had dreamed pleasantly of all
the money that she would soon be able to handle, and had decided
to buy a piano for the parlour and a marble-topped
washhand-stand, with a pink toilet set, for the front
bedroom.&nbsp; It would be a pity, she reflected, to get rid of a
full wage-earner in exchange for a little personal dignity.</p>
<p>So, suddenly relenting, she became towards Abner the
incarnation of sweetness.&nbsp; Abner, however, wasn&rsquo;t
having any.&nbsp; Even though he didn&rsquo;t see through her, he
felt that her attitude was rather too good to be true.&nbsp; For
the present he went on his way, paying regularly his weekly
&lsquo;lodge&rsquo; and the subscription to an industrial
death-policy that had been taken out in the year of his birth to
provide for his burial.&nbsp; But with the fulfilment of these
obligations, his dealings with Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages
ceased.&nbsp; He became a lodger pure and simple, only appearing
at night, when the others had gone to bed, tired, and ready to
tumble into the nest of blankets which Alice had not disturbed
since he left them in the morning.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t going to put herself out for him, she
said.&nbsp; In those days she didn&rsquo;t feel inclined to put
herself out for anybody.&nbsp; Unfortunately she couldn&rsquo;t
have it both ways; for by frightening Abner away with her temper
she had lost the use of his strength in the heavier work of the
house.&nbsp; She knew that she couldn&rsquo;t ask her husband to
help her.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t married her for that.&nbsp; Her
weary, and palpably interested attempts to coax Abner back to her
were a failure.&nbsp; Without showing a vestige of bitterness he
went stolidly on his way, and so she resigned herself, with a
sort of tired pride, to the heaviness of her lot.</p>
<p>In a way this desertion of Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages was a good
thing for Abner, for it drove him out into the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>open air and
rid his lungs of the coal-dust that he breathed in the galleries
of the pit.&nbsp; Joe Hodgetts, now more than ever his friend and
admirer, shared these joys.&nbsp; Together they roamed over all
the sweet country-side that ponders above the smoke of
Mawne.&nbsp; They did not know that it was beautiful.&nbsp; They
only knew that there were banks of hazel under which one might
play pitch and toss or nap without the fear of a policeman; that
there were cool streams with bottoms of red sand in which it was
good to bathe; that there were rabbits that came out timidly in
the evening to be shot with catapults, and wood-pigeons that
rustled the trees on the edge of Uffdown Wood and then emerged
with clapping wings.</p>
<p>Both boys had the instincts of poachers, and in the spring
another partner joined them: an equivocal terrier with a sandy
coat, a long, thin tail and a guttersnipe&rsquo;s intelligence
which Abner got for the asking from a miner at Mawne who
didn&rsquo;t think the beast worth the cost of a licence.&nbsp;
He couldn&rsquo;t house the animal in Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages,
for Alice couldn&rsquo;t abear dogs . . . the dirty beasts!&nbsp;
Abner&rsquo;s old friend, Mrs Moseley, came to his help.&nbsp;
The dog, now christened Tiger, found a home in her washhouse,
living among his hoarded bones on a strip of sacking in the
ash-hole beneath the copper.&nbsp; Here he would lie in the
evening waiting for his master, his thin snout pressed to the
ground between extended paws, motionless, pretending to be
asleep.&nbsp; When he heard Abner&rsquo;s step approaching he
would lie still, with gleaming open eyes, and wait for his name
to be called.&nbsp; Then he would leap out and lick the pit-dust
from Abner&rsquo;s face with his tongue.&nbsp; Even Mrs Moseley,
who fed him, was nothing to Tiger if Abner were there.</p>
<p>Together they would go out into the golden evening hunting
rabbits which Abner would sometimes bring home to Mrs Moseley,
who had a way of cooking them with onions soused in milk.&nbsp;
They were a great treat to her, for being a widow and no longer
employed in John Fellows&rsquo;s house, she rarely tasted
meat.&nbsp; Sharing the proceeds of their hunting Abner and Mrs
Moseley would sit late over their tea next day, and Tiger, under
the table, would crack the rabbit&rsquo;s head and lick out <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the brains
with his pointed tongue.&nbsp; Later in the week Mrs Moseley
would sell the rabbit-skin to a rag-and-bones man for
twopence.&nbsp; She was really very fond of Abner, and even if he
hadn&rsquo;t brought food to the house she would have been glad
of his visits, &lsquo;for company&rsquo; as she called it.</p>
<p>Because he kept the dog there, and because he was happy in Mrs
Moseley&rsquo;s society, Abner made her cottage his real
home.&nbsp; It stood last in one of a series of parallel streets
that climbed desperately out of the dust of the Stourton Road
towards a low crest facing Uffdown and the other hills of its
chain.&nbsp; The lower story looked out on a wall of the local
blue brick; but the windows of the bedroom, a stuffy chamber in
which the widow spent the greater part of her day, and which the
district nurse penetrated every morning in a whiff of iodoform
for the purpose of dressing Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s bad leg,
commanded, beyond a foreground of cinder-waste, blue distances
from which the hill air could have blown in cleanly.&nbsp; The
doctor had told Mrs Moseley that her leg would never heal unless
she gave it rest, and since all her relatives were now married
and too prosperous to give the old woman a thought, she was left
to herself, hobbling from the bedroom to the kitchen whenever it
was necessary to bank up the fire.&nbsp; On the hob stood a
teapot, brewing a decoction of tannin which had long since ruined
her digestion but was the thing for which she cared most in
life.&nbsp; She called it her &lsquo;cup of tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner rarely noticed what an effort she made to receive him
cheerfully when he came for his dog.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t see
how slow and painful her movements were becoming.&nbsp; She never
seemed to him any different from the Mrs Moseley whom he had
always known and taken for granted, until, one day, she was put
to bed and forbidden to move at all.&nbsp; She had spent the
whole morning crying to herself, for it seemed to her that the
day was not distant when she would have to be moved to Stourton
workhouse, to be carried downstairs and placed in the black van
before a crowd of gaping neighbours, dirty women with babies in
their arms.&nbsp; She had always been shy of the people who <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>lived near
her.&nbsp; A country woman, she felt out of place with these
industrial folk.&nbsp; She wished very much that she might
die.</p>
<p>When Abner came into the house that evening he found the grate
cold and full of ashes.&nbsp; He ran into the washhouse to fetch
Tiger, but the dog was not there.&nbsp; Then he heard the voice
of Mrs Moseley, distressed and quavering, calling him from above,
and a minute later Tiger came scampering downstairs, thoroughly
ashamed of himself, from his nest on Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s
bed.&nbsp; Abner, standing at the bottom of the stairs, listened
to the story of her troubles.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t tell him
much about them, and nothing at all about the deeper fears that
haunted her.&nbsp; She told him to get a cup of tea for himself,
but when he suggested bringing another upstairs to her she was
scandalised.&nbsp; Even though she was old enough to be his
grandmother she thought that this would be indelicate; besides,
she couldn&rsquo;t be quite certain that the cleanliness of her
bedroom was beyond reproach, and had determined that before any
one visited her, leg or no leg, she must spend a day putting
things straight.&nbsp; And of course the floor must be scrubbed
with carbolic soap.&nbsp; She begged Abner to get her some from
Mr Ingleby&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>Later, as the days of her imprisonment lengthened, she found
that she couldn&rsquo;t be so independent after all.&nbsp; At an
immense sacrifice she consented to the presence of Abner in her
room, that narrow, ill-lighted chamber which the bulging
four-poster nearly filled, where, in fact, it was the only piece
of furniture.&nbsp; Here Abner would sit in the hot evenings of
summer, staring through the closed windows at the distant hills,
while Mrs Moseley, in a tired, unhurried voice, talked of things
that had happened in his childhood and other days, more remote,
when his mother had been alive.&nbsp; The old woman had always
been fond of Abner, always a little frightened of his father; and
now that this tall youth was repaying her in some degree for the
care that she had given him in his childhood, she became very
tender toward him.&nbsp; At times his coming made her vaguely
emotional, her tenderness helping her to realise how very lonely
she was.&nbsp; Sometimes, when <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>she heard his step in the room
beneath her, she would very nearly cry, and the dog Tiger, lying
on the patchwork quilt, would lick her outstretched arm.&nbsp;
She began to count on his visits.&nbsp; Indeed, rather than lose
him, she would even have consented to have the bedroom windows
opened.</p>
<p>He never spoke of his own accord about Alice, but Mrs Moseley
compelled him to do so, inquiring every day how she was getting
on.&nbsp; She had promised John Fellows, to whom she was always
grateful for her old employment, that she would be in the house
during the confinement, and to lend the doctor a hand.&nbsp; John
Fellows remembered well what a tower of strength she had been at
the time when Abner was born.&nbsp; In those days she had
possessed a comfortable figure and a jolly laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want her there!&rsquo; Alice had
protested.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather have <i>anyone</i> with
me nor her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t object to Mrs Moseley in herself, but she was
suspicious of any one who had known the house before she came
there, convinced that the old woman would sniff at her
improvements and perhaps make mischief, poking her nose into all
the drawers and cupboards while she, the mistress, was in
bed.&nbsp; And perhaps John Fellows would compare Mrs
Moseley&rsquo;s cooking with her own!&nbsp; But her husband
wasn&rsquo;t having any nonsense of that kind.&nbsp; &lsquo;Silly
wench, yo&rsquo; don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s good for
you!&rsquo; he said, considering the matter settled.&nbsp; Alice
cried; but he didn&rsquo;t take any notice of that sort of
thing.</p>
<p>As the time drew nearer it distressed Mrs Moseley to think
that she might still be in bed when she was wanted.&nbsp; She
wished to be there not only for the sake of the husband but also
because she couldn&rsquo;t afford to miss the ten shillings that
her fortnight&rsquo;s work would bring her, to say nothing of the
fortnight&rsquo;s keep.&nbsp; Abner was impatient with her
questions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; worry about
<i>her</i>,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s not worth
it.&nbsp; Got a temper like a cat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t say that, dear,&rsquo; said Mrs
Moseley.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s the mother that the
Lord&rsquo;s given you.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s hard days for women
when they&rsquo;re like that.&nbsp; <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>I&rsquo;ve been through it myself, so
I know what they feels like.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be different when
the baby comes along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Abner was sure it wouldn&rsquo;t be different.&nbsp; It
would take more than a baby to change Alice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Besides, she bain&rsquo;t my mother,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A regular cat . . . that&rsquo;s what she bin!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;m the nearest I&rsquo;ve ever had to a
mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Moseley smiled.&nbsp; Secretly, when he wasn&rsquo;t
looking, she wiped her left eye on the patchwork counterpane.</p>
<h2><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>The
Third Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the middle of a summer night
Abner&rsquo;s father came blundering into his son&rsquo;s
bedroom.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come along, get a shift on you!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go and holler to Mrs Moseley, and then run on
to the doctor&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In his hand he carried a candle which lit up his surly face
and threw the folds on either side of the grimy wrinkles into
relief.&nbsp; His eyes were bleared and angry, for he had been
sleeping like a log and resented any disturbance at night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It bain&rsquo;t no good my going for her,&rsquo; said
Abner sleepily.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s got a bad
leg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bad leg be bosted!&rsquo; shouted John Fellows.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll have to come if I send for her.&nbsp;
Tak&rsquo; your hook now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>While Abner dressed, his father was prowling from room to room
letting the tallow from the candle drip clown the front of his
trousers, and shouting at the boy to hurry up from time to
time.&nbsp; In a few minutes Abner was ready and had crossed the
patch of waste ground that lay between the terrace and the
Stourton Road.&nbsp; This highway was more desolate than he had
ever seen it before.&nbsp; In some of the upper windows subdued
gas-jets were burning, but most of them took on the gray light of
a moon that could not be seen.&nbsp; He was halfway into Halesby
before he really woke.&nbsp; Then, in the cool night air, he
forgot his grudge against his father for waking him.&nbsp; Even
the foul dust of the Stourton Road smelt sweet.&nbsp; He had
never felt fitter nor more awake in his life.</p>
<p>As he reached Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s door Tiger began to
bark.&nbsp; He heard the voice of Mrs Moseley trying to soothe
the beast.&nbsp; Then he picked up some pebbles and threw them
against the window panes, and a moment later the old woman looked
out, Tiger scrambling into the window beside her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our father wants you,&rsquo; he called.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve got to go for the doctor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear, dear,&rsquo; said Mrs Moseley, &lsquo;I knew it
would <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>happen like this.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t disappoint your
father for anything . . . that I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you take no notice of it!&rsquo; Abner
urged.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you come!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell
&rsquo;em the doctor won&rsquo;t let you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head solemnly and disappeared from the
window.</p>
<p>Abner, exhilarated with the night air, ran on to the
doctor&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; This gentleman appeared to resent his
call.&nbsp; Abner was told to wait below so that he might carry
the bag.&nbsp; He stood there in a garden heavy with the perfume
of stocks.&nbsp; In the meadows along the Stour a corncrake was
calling.&nbsp; He wondered what kind of bird it was, and whether
it was easy to kill.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t mind how long the
doctor kept him waiting.</p>
<p>On the way back to Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages Dr Moorhouse spoke
very little.&nbsp; He asked Abner the kind of questions he
usually put to young people, and grunted in reply, as if he
hadn&rsquo;t heard what Abner said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you John Fellows&rsquo;s son?&rsquo; he
asked.&nbsp; And then: &lsquo;How old are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Abner said that he was going in seventeen, he
grunted.&nbsp; It scarcely seemed possible that more than sixteen
years had passed since, in the same small house of
Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages, he had ushered this tall youth into the
world.&nbsp; It filled him with a kind of discontent to realise
that for all these years he had been moving in the same groove,
in a vicious circle that had brought him back once more to this
identical point.&nbsp; Only it hadn&rsquo;t been so hard to turn
out at night sixteen years ago.&nbsp; A dog&rsquo;s life!&nbsp;
People didn&rsquo;t realise it.&nbsp; There was Ingleby, the
chemist, a sensible man in most things, fool enough to make his
only son a doctor!</p>
<p>When they reached Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages they found the door
of number eleven open and a light shining in it.&nbsp; John
Fellows came out to meet them and insisted on shaking hands with
the doctor.&nbsp; It was obvious that he had been sampling the
bottle of brandy that is always in evidence on these
occasions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s all right, doctor.&nbsp; A tough wench she
is!&nbsp; Tougher than the other one.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>He
turned on Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get the fire lit.&nbsp; Sharp,
now!&nbsp; Else I&rsquo;ll drap thee one.&nbsp; Fill the big
kettle.&nbsp; Plenty of hot water.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it,
isn&rsquo;t it, doctor?&nbsp; I know . . . don&rsquo;t I, doctor?
. . .&nbsp; I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somebody came limping downstairs.&nbsp; It was Mrs
Moseley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What . . .?&rsquo; shouted the doctor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&nbsp; What do you mean
by it, woman?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to stay in bed till I
let you out?&nbsp; Of all the damned pig-headed foolishness . .
&lsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Moseley smiled her tired, patient smile; but the doctor
knew she was in pain.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t help admiring
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll forgive me all right, doctor,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, what could I do with the poor young thing
lying here like that . . . and after all I&rsquo;d promised Mr
Fellows here?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember the last
time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m hanged if I&rsquo;ll forgive you,&rsquo;
he smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re an obstinate old fool.&nbsp;
Now run along upstairs.&nbsp; If you lose your leg it&rsquo;s not
my fault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner was left alone in the kitchen with his father.&nbsp;
While the boy raked out the ashes from the grate and lit the fire
John Fellows took the brandy from the cupboard and had another
swig, putting the neck of the bottle in his mouth.&nbsp; He said
&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; and smacked his lips.&nbsp; Then he went out
into the strip of garden at the back and walked violently up and
down.&nbsp; It was almost light when he returned.&nbsp; He was
sweating and quarrelsome.&nbsp; Abner had a bad time of it.&nbsp;
Now that his poor mother was suffering like this John Fellows
hoped he&rsquo;d be sorry for the way he&rsquo;d used her.&nbsp;
If anything went wrong&mdash;he implied gloomily that something
probably would&mdash;Abner would be to blame for it.&nbsp; To
give his fuddled brain the chance for indignation that it wanted
there entered the dog Tiger, fawning, ingratiating.&nbsp; He had
escaped from Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s house and followed the scent of
her or of Abner.&nbsp; He jumped up at Abner, yelping with
joy.</p>
<p>For a second John Fellow&rsquo;s stared at him stupidly.&nbsp;
Then he burst out with: &lsquo;And here&rsquo;s that bloody dog
again!&nbsp; Your mother&rsquo;s told you she can&rsquo;t a-bear
it, but she&rsquo;s no sooner upstairs . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; He
slipped the <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>belt from his waist and lashed at the wretched
Tiger&rsquo;s quarters.&nbsp; The dog squealed piteously.&nbsp;
For a moment Abner saw red.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t see his father
any longer, only a stubby man, shorter than himself, staring at
him with bloodshot eyes, and sweat trickling down two grimy
wrinkles.&nbsp; He would have knocked his father down if Mrs
Moseley hadn&rsquo;t suddenly appeared at the foot of the stairs
asking what the noise was about.&nbsp; The sound of her voice
steadied both of them as they stood staring hatred at one
another, and Abner&rsquo;s anger passed as quickly as it had
come.&nbsp; Mrs Moseley, standing between them, brought with her
a pungent odour of some antiseptic.&nbsp; The smell impressed
Abner with the moment&rsquo;s seriousness.&nbsp; He was suddenly
sorry for Alice.&nbsp; He even wished that he had been more
patient with her.&nbsp; Then the whole sky was shaken with the
vibrations of the great bull at Mawne Colliery.&nbsp;
Five-thirty.&nbsp; He slipped into his pit clothes, left his
father staring, and hurried from the house.</p>
<p>When he came back from his turn at night the sense of stress
that he had quite forgotten in the work of the day
returned.&nbsp; On the doorstep of Number Eleven he felt
intensely nervous.&nbsp; Something was going to happen, perhaps
something had happened already.&nbsp; The house was quiet.&nbsp;
In the kitchen a fire was burning that made for cheerfulness in
spite of the heat.&nbsp; All this was attributable to Mrs
Moseley, who now appeared with an encouraging smile.&nbsp; She
told him that Alice&rsquo;s baby had been born at ten
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; &lsquo;And when I got her clean and
comfortable and washed the baby, I thought, &ldquo;Well, now,
while I&rsquo;m on my legs I may as well have a bit of a tidy
round.&rdquo;&nbsp; A lovely boy!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, what a beautiful babby&mdash;just like his
father!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner didn&rsquo;t want to hear about the baby.&nbsp; He stuck
to his obstinate determination not to countenance the affair at
all, and Mrs Moseley laughed at him for behaving like a baby
himself.&nbsp; He asked her what had happened to his father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him, not since you went to
work.&nbsp; But men&rsquo;s best out of the way at these
times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner guessed that, once having started to drink, his <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>father had
probably been drinking all day and might well by this time be
lying drunk in some hedge at the back of the Royal Oak.&nbsp; Mrs
Moseley rebuked him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re hard on your father, Abner,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bad time for a man when he feels
he can&rsquo;t do nothing.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t love and honour
your father the way you ought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All through the fortnight of Alice&rsquo;s lying-in Mrs
Moseley did her best to keep the peace of the house and to
reconcile Abner to the new state of things.&nbsp; She made him
feel almost as much at home as he had been in the old days,
limping downstairs in the evening to talk to him.&nbsp; Alice was
very jealous when she heard them talking below.&nbsp; On most
evenings they sat alone in the kitchen together, but sometimes
they went out into the strip of garden at the back of the house
to a wooden bench screened by a straggling hedge of scarlet
runners.&nbsp; They sat there, often in silence, till the sky
darkened, reflecting above the western horizon all the furnaces
of Mawne; and no one disturbed them, for John Fellows, having
once yielded to the bottle, had continued his celebrations of the
event.&nbsp; After all, such things didn&rsquo;t happen very
often.</p>
<p>One evening Mrs Moseley brought down the baby for Abner to
see.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at him, Abner,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;bain&rsquo;t he a pretty dear? bain&rsquo;t he a little
lovee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whatever the baby may have been he certainly wasn&rsquo;t
pretty; but there was something in his helplessness that appealed
to Abner&rsquo;s generosity.&nbsp; In spite of his prejudices he
couldn&rsquo;t see himself being vindictive toward this comical
creature.&nbsp; He touched the baby&rsquo;s downy, wrinkled face
with his hand.&nbsp; The creature made a sucking noise, seeking
Abner&rsquo;s fingers with his lips, and at the same moment
Tiger, with a snarl, took Abner&rsquo;s calf between his teeth,
and, with the gentlest pressure, threatened to bite him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There you are,&rsquo; said Mrs Moseley.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Look at jealousy!&nbsp; You and Tiger are a pair, and
that&rsquo;s the truth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed, but for all that he didn&rsquo;t look forward
happily to Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp; He felt that the
baby would only serve to make Alice more intolerably
important.&nbsp; When, on the thirteenth night, a <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>dead-white,
incredibly diminished Alice came down to sit for a couple of
hours on the sofa, he decided to ask Mrs Moseley to take him into
her house as a lodger.&nbsp; &lsquo;The money will come in
handy,&rsquo; he urged.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could sleep in the
washhouse with old Tiger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she wouldn&rsquo;t think of it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t do it,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t like to put your father out, not if it was ever
so!&nbsp; John&rsquo;s been a good friend to me.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how I could have lived all these years without
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s got a sight more out of yo&rsquo; than ever
yo&rsquo; got out of him!&rsquo; Abner grumbled.</p>
<p>But again she said &lsquo;No&rsquo;&mdash;partly, it is true,
because she felt that Alice might make it the occasion for a
quarrel, and partly because, much as she loved Abner she knew
that her strength would not allow her to look after him
properly.&nbsp; On many days of late she hadn&rsquo;t really been
fit to do her own housework, and so she fought shy, for
Abner&rsquo;s sake as much as her own, of the arrangement that he
suggested.&nbsp; The money, alas! was very tempting.</p>
<p>Abner, who didn&rsquo;t generally notice things particularly
and had always taken people like Mrs Moseley for granted, had not
appreciated the changes that were slowly overtaking her.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t see the slight contraction of her brows that had
lately become a fixed expression of the pain that wouldn&rsquo;t
let her be.&nbsp; Neither he nor Alice nor John Fellows were
aware of Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s suffering; but the doctor, on his
daily visits, saw how gamely she was fighting, and said nothing;
for he knew that to abstain from obvious advice was the highest
tribute that he could pay to her fortitude.&nbsp; He knew that
there was trouble ahead, but he still joked with Mrs Moseley, and
she, in answer, returned him a smile that struck him as
particularly sweet in this plain old woman, making excuse for the
reproach that remained unspoken.&nbsp; In the end, Abner, piqued
at her refusal, quarrelled with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any one &lsquo;d think I was likely to be a
nuisance,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mrs Moseley shook her head.&nbsp; She nearly told him all her
reasons against his plan, but when she came to <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>speak of them
her lips trembled.&nbsp; She knew that she couldn&rsquo;t keep up
much longer.&nbsp; On the fifteenth day she left Hackett&rsquo;s
Cottages.&nbsp; Alice, who paid her the agreed ten shillings from
a leather purse that she kept wrapped up in a handkerchief under
her pillow, thought it rather shabby of her not to offer to stay
longer.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d think it &lsquo;d be the least
she could do after all your kindness,&rsquo; she said to her
husband.&nbsp; John Fellows, not to be buttered with flattery,
merely grunted.</p>
<p>It took Mrs Moseley more than an hour to walk the mile
home.&nbsp; The doctor passing in his trap, saw her resting on a
doorstep in the Stourton Road.&nbsp; He pretended not to
recognise her, but scribbled a note on his list that she was to
be visited in the afternoon.&nbsp; Toward evening he stumped up
the crooked stairs and stood at the bottom of her bed looking at
her with a curious smile on his lips.&nbsp; She knew it was no
good making excuses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at it,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
And then: &lsquo;Well, my dear, this means six weeks in
bed.&nbsp; You know that, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Ten
shillings&rsquo; worth, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Moseley, conscious of the fact that it was worth a good
deal more than ten shillings, said nothing.&nbsp; If he only
realised what a blessed relief it was to her to be off her feet
again!</p>
<p>When Alice &lsquo;came downstairs&rsquo; again, butter
wouldn&rsquo;t melt in her mouth.&nbsp; Abner had never known her
so studiously charming.&nbsp; From the first it was as if she
smiled: &lsquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake let us forget what has
happened and make a new start!&rsquo; and he couldn&rsquo;t very
well refuse to meet her.&nbsp; At the same time he found it
difficult to conceal his suspicions that she was getting at him
in some covert, female way.&nbsp; The situation would have been
easier to handle if Alice hadn&rsquo;t been a trifle pale and
interesting.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t pick up very quickly, and
now, of course, in addition to the ordinary housework she had to
look after the baby, who was already suffering from its
mother&rsquo;s dietetic indiscretions.&nbsp; Like many thin young
women Alice could never conquer her inclination for sweets and
for vinegar, and as a consequence the child was noisy and
irritable.&nbsp; Her housework went to the wall, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and in
despair she turned to Abner to help her out.&nbsp; Nothing could
have been sweeter than her temper, and though he didn&rsquo;t
believe in it he couldn&rsquo;t help being sorry for her, and did
what she asked him.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he was already a
little interested in the baby.&nbsp; The smallness of its limbs
and the timid uncertainty of its movements fascinated him.&nbsp;
He regarded it with a certain benignant curiosity, much as he
might have looked at a nestling taken from a hedge in April.</p>
<p>Of course Alice was feeding her child at the breast.&nbsp; If
Abner came into the kitchen in the middle of this performance she
would turn round quickly and take the baby upstairs or out into
the washhouse, blushing.&nbsp; Abner wondered why she did
this.&nbsp; Other women weren&rsquo;t so sensitive.&nbsp;
Sometimes he would pass a couple of them standing at their garden
gates gossiping and feeding their babies at the same time.&nbsp;
He had never taken any notice of them.&nbsp; Nobody else took any
notice of them.&nbsp; There was something in Alice&rsquo;s
blushes that embarrassed him unreasonably.&nbsp; Afterward he
asked himself why this should be; but when next he saw Alice
hiding her white breast he blushed himself.</p>
<p>The new relation was very curious.&nbsp; If it hadn&rsquo;t
been for Abner&rsquo;s profound distrust of her they might even
have become intimate.&nbsp; It was no good for Alice to pretend
that she wasn&rsquo;t lonely.&nbsp; In spite of all her pride in
being a married woman and the mother of a family&rsquo;s
beginning, she couldn&rsquo;t conceal the fact that since the
baby&rsquo;s birth her husband took very little notice of
her.&nbsp; It was as if he had said: &lsquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve
done my duty by the nation and given you something to play with
you can just attend to my comforts without bothering
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had lately transferred his custom from the
Greyhound to the Lyttleton Arms.&nbsp; A shorter walk at closing
time.&nbsp; So far he had never maltreated Alice, but she knew
very well that she couldn&rsquo;t now play him the tricks that
had pleased him in their courting days.</p>
<p>So, from being with her husband like a little girl in school,
with Abner she behaved like a schoolgirl <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>released,
chattering, eager and friendly.&nbsp; It puzzled him, for he had
never had a sister and didn&rsquo;t understand the creature in
the least.&nbsp; Her flatteries and sudden kindnesses surprised
him every bit as much as her spurts of temper.&nbsp; In each case
she seemed equally childish, particularly on days when she had
been too busy to do her hair and wore it in a honey-coloured
pigtail at the back.&nbsp; Then, there was another Alice who
could assert with something very near to dignity the fact that
she was mistress of the house; and another, blushing Alice,
before whom he too had blushed.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, her most obvious feature was her
kindness.&nbsp; In the evening, when Abner came home dirty from
the pit, he would find the soap-suds waiting for him and tea laid
ready on the kitchen table.&nbsp; Alice, as likely as not, would
be bathing the baby, who already showed a native sturdiness in
spite of his mother&rsquo;s indiscretions.&nbsp; While Abner ate
his tea she would talk to the baby in a low, cooing voice, which
she was evidently convinced would fetch him.&nbsp; From time to
time in the middle of these whispers, she would look up sideways
to where Abner sat munching bread and butter with the sunlight in
his hair.&nbsp; Abner, who knew that he was good-looking, and was
now a little conscious of his manly superiority, took no notice
of her.</p>
<p>And yet, in the end, he couldn&rsquo;t help being dragged into
the atmosphere of intimacy which her small attentions
created.&nbsp; Grudgingly he was forced to admit that she had
changed for the better.&nbsp; He was now old enough to be
flattered too.&nbsp; They became almost good friends, and only
Abner&rsquo;s native cautiousness prevented a complete
reconciliation.&nbsp; Alice knew this.&nbsp; She knew the shy
spirit with which she had to deal, but was happy to feel that she
had accomplished so much already.&nbsp; Somewhere in the back of
her mind she suspected that a time might come in which she would
rely on Abner&rsquo;s strength to protect her and her baby.&nbsp;
Some day she might need his help.&nbsp; It was of John Fellows,
her husband, that she was afraid.</p>
<p>This new relation, Abner thought, was all very well.&nbsp; <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Still, just
because they had patched up their old quarrel, they needn&rsquo;t
necessarily be always together.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t going to
abandon his friend, Joe Hodgetts, and Tiger for the sake of
feminine small talk.&nbsp; Nor did he mean to forsake Mrs
Moseley, at whose house the dog still slept.&nbsp; Those early
autumn evenings were great times for Tiger.&nbsp; Abner knew of a
dozen fields in which he could be certain of putting up a
hare.</p>
<p>It annoyed Alice to see him so eager to get away just when she
wanted him most.&nbsp; She knew that he went in to see Mrs
Moseley.&nbsp; She told herself that she had always hated the old
woman, even before she had been forced on her by her
husband.&nbsp; One evening when Abner was hurrying away after tea
she called him back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, Abner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Down town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;m going to Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t I go to Mrs
Moseley&rsquo;s?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t stop me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay with us to-night, Abner,&rsquo; she coaxed.</p>
<p>Abner only laughed at her.&nbsp; Then she flew into a passion,
standing up white and trembling at the side of the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you go to Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s?&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s Mrs Moseley, I should like to
know?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re all cracked on your Mrs Moseley, you and
your father!&nbsp; That fat old woman in her nasty smelly
house!&nbsp; And you didn&rsquo;t ought to leave me when I want
you.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t ought to!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m your mother
. . &lsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;m my mother, are you?&rsquo;&nbsp; Abner
burst into a laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s bloody funny, that
is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you and your swearing . . .&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t wait to hear any more.&nbsp; When he was gone
she fell down on her knees beside the table and sobbed with her
head in her hands: a frail, pathetic figure with her hair in
curling rags.&nbsp; Her sobs woke the baby, whose cradle had been
carefully placed in a draught between the open door and the
fireplace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you now!&rsquo; she cried, rocking the cradle
roughly.&nbsp; She might easily have upset it.&nbsp; Then,
suddenly repenting, she picked up her son tenderly, and hugging
him to her breast, buried her sobs in his downy face.</p>
<h2><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>The
Fourth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the autumn hardened into an iron
winter Abner had less time than ever to spend on these
distractions.&nbsp; When the football season opened he began to
play for the little club named Halesby Swifts, from which Mawne
United usually drew its recruits.&nbsp; Technically it was a
professional club, but the gate money that it drew from its
adventures in pursuit of the local charity cups did no more than
pay for the boots and clothes and footballs of the players.&nbsp;
In the first round of the North Bromwich Hospital Cup competition
the Swifts had the good luck to be drawn against their big
neighbours, Mawne United, on the Mawne ground, and Abner, playing
centre-half, repeated the exploit of his childhood by scoring a
goal against the goalkeeper who had succeeded the celebrated
Harper.&nbsp; It was an elevating moment.&nbsp; The captain and
others of the Swifts came running up to Abner and wrung his
hand.&nbsp; All Mawne and Halesby on the touchline waved black
bowler hats under the flag of Mawne United languidly flying from
its staff beside the Royal Oak.&nbsp; A great moment!&nbsp; Abner
did not see his father standing in his old place behind the Mawne
goal posts with his hands thrust into the pockets of his reefer
coat and his eyes sparkling as he puffed away at his black clay
pipe.&nbsp; That was how John Fellows showed his emotion.&nbsp;
Later in the evening he showed it in another way.</p>
<p>This match, however, made a considerable difference in John
Fellows&rsquo;s attitude.&nbsp; It gave Abner a standing with his
father that had never been granted to him before.&nbsp; Nor was
this the only result of his success; for on the following Monday
Mr Hudson, the chief clerk in Mr Willis&rsquo;s works at Mawne,
and secretary of the United, an irreproachable expert in a game
that he had never played, sent up a message to the pit for Abner,
and on Tuesday he had &lsquo;signed on&rsquo; for the senior
club.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A lad like you, growing and that,&rsquo; said Mr
Hudson, <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&lsquo;didn&rsquo;t ought to be working in the
pit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll speak to the manager, and if you&rsquo;ll
come down to the Furnaces next Monday we&rsquo;ll see what sort
of job we can find you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On Monday morning Abner walked over to the Stour valley in
which the great works lay angrily seething, and picked his way
through the gigantic debris of the iron age: huge discarded
boilers, brown with rust; scrap-heaps of tangled metal that had
served its day; stacks of rails; purple mountains of iron ore
standing ready for the blast-furnaces that snored like dragons in
their sleep and made the air around them quiver with hot
breath.&nbsp; Over a network of rails on which an officious
shunting-engine that the head of the firm had christened Lilian,
in honour of his daughter, ran to and fro, whistling shrill
warnings; over many steam pipes, snaky tentacles of the central
power-house, that hissed steam from their leaky joints, he passed
to the office that Mr Hudson inhabited.&nbsp; On the steps in the
middle of his path stood a tall, pale young man who stared out
over the works as though some vision entranced him.&nbsp; Abner,
wondering what he was looking at, and following the direction of
his eyes, saw nothing unusual.&nbsp; He knew that this was young
Mr Willis, Mr Edward, as Hudson called him.&nbsp; He asked Abner
what he wanted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Hudson, gaffer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find him inside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He moved out of the way, still, apparently in the toils of his
dream, and Abner was shown into Mr Hudson, whom he found sitting
at a desk with a pencil behind either ear.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, here
you are,&rsquo; said Mr Hudson.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good
chap!&rsquo; and took him straightway to one of the foremen, an
old butty of John Fellows, who gave him an indefinite labouring
job that consisted of moving metallic rubbish from one part of
the works to another as occasion demanded.&nbsp; At Mawne, it
seemed, no fragment of iron was ever allowed to leave the works
as long as there was a foot of space in which it could be
stored.&nbsp; Abner also had to grease the wheels of a little
line of trolley-trucks that blundered up and down the hill in
front of the manager&rsquo;s house, between the furnaces and the
high colliery of Timbertree.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&lsquo;This is work for an old man, not for a strong lad
like you,&rsquo; the foreman grumbled.&nbsp; He knew that there
was always work above ground and good pay at Mawne for a
promising footballer.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll fause you up
now!&nbsp; Wait till your footballing&rsquo;s over,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;wait till you&rsquo;ve broke your leg, and then you
ask your Mr Hudson for a job like this and see what he&rsquo;ll
tell you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Abner was seventeen and had no thoughts for age.&nbsp; The
greatest delight of all was that he now breathed the air of the
open sky all day instead of the darkness of the pit; and even if
the ecstasy of his evening&rsquo;s relief was now blunted, there
seemed to be no end to his capacity for physical enjoyment.&nbsp;
Beneath the caresses of air and light his physique began to
expand.&nbsp; He took a delight in the strict training that the
Mawne United directors enforced on their players.&nbsp; With
skipping and rubbing and sprinting his muscles became hard and
supple and his whole body marvellously fit.&nbsp; Football became
his whole life.&nbsp; In his work at Mawne, even in his dreams,
he pondered on its tactics.&nbsp; All his friends were players
absorbed in the same game.&nbsp; He gained confidence and skill,
and by the end of the season he had become one of the
crowd&rsquo;s idols, followed from the arena by a trail of small
boys and patted on the back by strangers as he walked home after
a match in his muddy clothes.&nbsp; The girls also used to turn
and look at him with bold glances; but his life was far too full
in those days for him to worry his head about women.</p>
<p>His relation with Alice had now passed its first emotional
stage, and though she was more interested in him than she had
ever been before, she had grown to understand him better, so that
the storms which had made life at Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages so
intense no longer occurred.&nbsp; She washed his football clothes
with care and fed him regularly and well, as indeed she should
have done, for he was now earning good money.&nbsp; She had
discovered that it paid her best not to worry him.&nbsp;
Sometimes a fit of restlessness would make him say that he must
change his lodging; but although he often grumbled, he still
stayed on in the room that he had occupied since he was a
child.&nbsp; In her anxiety <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>to please him she even offered of her
own accord to have the dog Tiger in the house; but Abner only
stared at her, wondering what she was getting at, and
laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still jealous of the poor old woman?&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Of course she was still jealous of Mrs Moseley.&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t help being jealous; but though she denied this
indignantly, and even tried to prove her goodwill by paying
several awkward visits with the baby to Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s
bedroom, she knew very well that the old woman&rsquo;s
attractions for Abner were the very least that she had to
fear.&nbsp; She was really and deeply jealous of the young women
who stared at him on the football field or in the Stourton
Road.&nbsp; She knew how handsome he was growing; realised, with
an agony that was not wholly maternal, that sooner or later he
was bound to fall in love, and that was a calamity which somehow
she felt she could not bear.&nbsp; Little by little John Fellows
was becoming less important to her.&nbsp; All her life seemed
more and more centred in her baby and in Abner.&nbsp; Thinking
the matter over she decided that it was her best policy to
encourage him in his friendship for the old woman, and she did so
gradually, insidiously, so that Abner should not guess what she
was doing or wonder why she was doing it.</p>
<p>Abner needed no encouragement.&nbsp; He had never wavered from
his loyalty, and now more than ever he felt that he owed some
attention to his old friend.&nbsp; Since the day when she had
taken to her bed after the fortnight&rsquo;s work at
Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages, she had never recovered sufficiently to
resume her former activities.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, it had
seemed that her leg was on the point of healing; but as soon as
she crawled downstairs and tried to go about her business it
broke down again, which was not surprising seeing how much her
lying in bed had weakened her.&nbsp; The doctor could do nothing
but preach patience and leave her in the hands of the district
nurse.</p>
<p>For a whole year she struggled along on the pittance that the
relieving officer gave her; but at last the disorder of the
cottage became so overwhelming that the nurse took the law into
her own hands and, in spite of all Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s protests,
wrote a letter to <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>the nearest of the old woman&rsquo;s relatives, a
younger sister, the wife of a North Bromwich brass-worker named
Wade.</p>
<p>In answer to the letter Mrs Wade came over to see her sister,
dressed as for a funeral in closely-fitting black sateen.&nbsp;
Being rather afraid that she might find it awkward to get out of
taking Mrs Moseley home with her, the sight of the old
woman&rsquo;s helplessness gave her a distinct feeling of relief
which showed itself in the warmth of her condolences.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Eliza, this is a shame, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; And
my! won&rsquo;t George be shocked when I tell him?&nbsp; To think
of your never &rsquo;aving let us know!&nbsp; Just to think of
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Moseley feebly protested that it wasn&rsquo;t her fault
that the Wades had been told even now.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to be a trouble to people,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; Mrs Wade
assured her that she wasn&rsquo;t anything of the kind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;George, he says to me: &ldquo;Now, Florrie, you mind
you bring Eliza hack with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, of course, any
one could see with half a glance that that&rsquo;s impossible
like you are.&nbsp; We could have made you that comfortable,
too!&nbsp; We &rsquo;ave a lovely little &rsquo;ouse.&nbsp; What
with the money George is picking up, and what we&rsquo;ve
saved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By the time of the evening train on which her sister had
promised to return to North Bromwich, Mrs Moseley was heartily
sick of George&rsquo;s name and achievements.&nbsp; She
hadn&rsquo;t really ever known her sister Florrie, and now she
felt that in spite of her suave manner and affectation of
kindnesses that cost nothing she had really come to spy out the
nakedness of the land, to check the value of her sister&rsquo;s
scanty effects, to reckon just how much lay between her and the
workhouse.&nbsp; And all the time Mrs Moseley was in a fever
wondering what the house was like downstairs; whether, in her
absence, dirt had accumulated; whether Tiger had made the
washhouse in a mess.&nbsp; Indeed, when Mrs Wade departed, she
crept downstairs to see for herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whatever they
says&rsquo;&mdash;this was always her cry&mdash;&lsquo;they
can&rsquo;t say I bain&rsquo;t clean!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The upshot of this visit was revealed to Abner a week or two
later, when he arrived one evening to find the faithless Tiger
playing at the knee of a stranger, <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>a girl with the city&rsquo;s matte
complexion, hair that was almost black with a gleam of copper in
it, and brown, long-lashed eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That your dog?&rsquo; she said, smiling.&nbsp; Her
voice was low.&nbsp; Abner was now used to the high-pitched
voices of Alice and her neighbours.&nbsp; He had never heard a
woman speak so quietly.</p>
<p>He said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and she, with the utmost
self-possession, told him that Tiger was a beauty.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t strictly true, but it gave Abner a flush of
pleasure, for he loved Tiger.&nbsp; Then she said:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m Susan Wade.&nbsp; Mother sent me here to look
after Auntie Liza for a week or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact mother, warned by a snuffy shilling-doctor
in Lower Sparkdale that Susan was an&aelig;mic and needed country
air, had suddenly felt more than usually generous toward her
sister, and sent Susan to &lsquo;help,&rsquo; with no more than
the price of her keep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Afford it?&rsquo; she said, when her husband questioned
her about Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s ability to feed another mouth,
&lsquo;Afford it?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know our Liza!&nbsp; She
was always the quiet one of the family.&nbsp; And a saving kind,
too.&nbsp; I know well enough she&rsquo;s got a stocking
somewhere!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Wade was not in the habit of arguing with his wife, and Mrs
Moseley, when Susan arrived at Halesby with a small wicker basket
containing her best dress and a bag of apples with mother&rsquo;s
love, was so deeply touched that when she kissed her her eyes
filled with tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be lonely,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;with an
old woman like me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall go out into the lanes,&rsquo; said Susan.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mother told me I must get all the fresh air I can.&nbsp;
For the blood, you know.&rsquo;&nbsp; That put the matter quite
plainly.</p>
<p>Mrs Moseley assured Abner that Susan was a dear, sweet child,
and such a little woman; but he never met her in Mrs
Moseley&rsquo;s presence, for the old lady had decided against
the impropriety of Susan and himself together beholding her in
bed.&nbsp; Awkward, at first, he found in a little while that she
wasn&rsquo;t as formidable as he imagined, though all his
triumphs in the <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>football field could not have given him one half of her
staggering self-possession.&nbsp; What impressed him most about
her was, without doubt, the sense of personal cleanliness that
she carried with her.&nbsp; Susan was on a holiday, and had time
for such refinements.&nbsp; She wore clean print dresses, while
Alice and her shrill-voiced neighbours in Hackett&rsquo;s
Cottages, by whose appearance Abner had regulated his ideas of
feminine nicety, wore, as a rule, the livery of their toil.&nbsp;
Susan, on the other hand, lived like a lady, having no better
work for her fingers than the braiding of her dark hair.&nbsp; In
the mornings she stayed with Mrs Moseley, listening, in a kind of
dream, to her aunt&rsquo;s recitation of the virtues of people
whom, in the days before her marriage, she had served.&nbsp; It
seemed as if that were the time in her life toward which her
thoughts now returned most happily, and the mere scraping
together of its unimportant details filled her with a mild
afterglow of enjoyment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember,&rsquo; she would begin, in a weak,
contented voice that was soothing in its tiredness, &lsquo;I
remember one day Mrs Willis&mdash;the first Mrs Willis that is,
old Mr Hackett&rsquo;s daughter down the Holloway and Mr
Edward&rsquo;s mother&mdash;I remember her coming into the
kitchen with a beautiful basketful of cherries.&nbsp; Fine, black
fruit they was!&nbsp; And she says
&ldquo;Hannah&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s the Hannah that&rsquo;s
still there, but I expect she&rsquo;s forgotten
<i>me</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Hannah,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;look what
the master&rsquo;s sent from the cherry-orchard.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They always call it the cherry-orchard, you know, up above Mawne
bank, and that was a wonderful year for cherries.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make them into jam, Hannah,&rdquo; she
says.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Liza&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
me&mdash;&ldquo;will help you stone them.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Stone
them</i>, she says!&nbsp; And how we laughed to be sure!&nbsp; I
can see her standing there now, a bit red in the face, for she
was new to housekeeping and never knew you don&rsquo;t stone
cherries.&nbsp; She had a couple of black-hearts in her lips,
like the game you play.&nbsp; A dear lady, she was!&nbsp; I can
see her again in Mr Edward.&nbsp; Time passes, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll know that some day, Susan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Susan tossed her head.&nbsp; Perhaps some day she would know,
but sufficient unto this were its quiet languors <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and the
breath of summer air drifting in at a chink in her aunt&rsquo;s
window from the fields towards the hills.&nbsp; She herself had
grown up in the cramped quarter of Sparkdale, where, in
summer-time the blue-brick pavements burn under a pale sky, where
there is always a smell of dust and fire and rotting remnants of
fruit dropped from the hawkers&rsquo; barrows into the
gutter.&nbsp; At the back of their house in Sparkdale lay a
little garden plot; but her father had always given it over to
fowls that made it an arid, gritty patch littered with shed
feathers.&nbsp; All the parks lay miles away over the streets,
and the only green that Susan knew was the grass that grew within
the railings of an ugly Georgian church standing in a square that
had once been fashionable but was now neglected and
unkempt.&nbsp; For this reason the sloping fields beyond Halesby
were wonderful to her, and things that would have seemed common
to a country child, enchanting.&nbsp; In the afternoon she went
out walking with Tiger.&nbsp; There was no need for Abner to be
jealous, for these walks bore no comparison in Tiger&rsquo;s mind
with his evening visits to rabbit-haunted banks.</p>
<p>Susan had come to Halesby thrilled by her first experience of
romance.&nbsp; She had been initiated by a pale young clerk named
Bagley who taught in the Sunday-school of the decayed Georgian
church.&nbsp; It had happened at their annual
&lsquo;outing&rsquo; to Sutton Park.&nbsp; There, in a hot slade
of larches, Mr Bagley had held her hand, a small and very sticky
hand in a lace mitten.&nbsp; While he did so he had confided to
her that his was an extremely passionate nature, and that nothing
but his hold on the Anglican faith restrained him from exploiting
it, and after this, immediately before tea, he had kissed her
once.&nbsp; That had been all; for after tea Mr Bagley, weighed
down no doubt by a sense of shame, had avoided her.&nbsp; All
that remained to her of this adventure was the power of making Mr
Bagley blush; and this was no very signal achievement, for Mr
Bagley flushed easily and had already written privily to
advertisers in the weekly papers who claimed to cure this
weakness.&nbsp; It appeared indeed that there would never be any
more between them than a bond of secret <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>guilt; and
since Susan had liked being kissed, even by Mr Bagley, she
decided to continue her experiments whenever the chance came.</p>
<p>From the first sight of him Abner had pleased her.&nbsp; He
was eighteen, just a year older than herself.&nbsp; His handsome
head, his excellent teeth, his contrasting fairness, the size and
strength of his body, all attracted her.&nbsp; She thought she
would like to be alone with him and see what would happen.&nbsp;
Therefore she began by inviting herself to accompany him on one
of his evening excursions with Tiger.&nbsp; Abner resented the
proposal, partly because he had never quite shaken off the
convention of his boyhood that girls were soft and any dealings
with them shameful, and partly because he was jealous of any
stranger invading a world that was so particularly his own and so
specially guarded from the feminine influence hitherto
represented by Alice.&nbsp; But Susan, by her quiet
determination, made it impossible for him to refuse.&nbsp; She
had always been&mdash;after the poultry&mdash;her father&rsquo;s
principal pet, and when Abner put her off, she simply declined to
believe that he meant it.</p>
<p>He grumbled and submitted.&nbsp; He supposed that he was doing
a kindness to Mrs Moseley by taking her, and comforted himself
with the thought that, after all, Susan wasn&rsquo;t like other
girls: a conclusion at which he arrived without difficulty,
seeing that he had known no other girl but Alice.&nbsp; On his
side, indeed, the relationship was as natural as it might
be.&nbsp; It was Susan who found it rather a failure in the
absence of sentimental developments.&nbsp; Abner treated her, she
found, very much as if she had been a boy; and though this was
the pose with which she had started their acquaintance, she
didn&rsquo;t want it to remain at that.&nbsp; Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s
looking-glass, in which she could see herself when she sat in her
favourite place at the foot of the bed in the morning, assured
her that she was much nicer to look at now than when she first
came to Halesby from the city.&nbsp; She was plumper, her cheeks
and lips were more brightly coloured and her eyes clearer.&nbsp;
Mr Bagley would have noticed the difference.&nbsp; Abner,
apparently, didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She comforted herself <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>with the
reflection that he was too rough and rugged to realise her
delicacy, that he was only a common labourer and no fit associate
for a foreman&rsquo;s daughter, but when she came to think of it,
her social quality should really have made her more attractive to
him.</p>
<p>She was a very direct young woman.&nbsp; One evening when they
went out for their walk down the lane that leads to the woody
basin known as Dovehouse Fields they came to a lonely stile at
the end of a bridge over a tributary of the Stour, beyond which
the red bank was tunnelled by many rabbits.&nbsp; Tiger ran
forward eagerly over the bridge and began to sniff at the holes
in the bank, and Abner would have followed him if Susan had not
barred the way, sitting complacently on the top of the
stile.&nbsp; She sat there in the low sunlight that warmed her
cheeks, lighted gleams of copper in her hair, and made her brown
eyes amber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to stay here, Abner,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, let us pass then,&rsquo; said Abner, thinking
only of rabbits.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wait till I come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she wouldn&rsquo;t move from her perch.&nbsp; She sat
there smiling and swinging her long legs.&nbsp; Tiger, who
couldn&rsquo;t realise why any scentless human should hesitate on
the verge of such excitements, ran back and looked at them,
making little quick noises of encouragement.&nbsp; Susan called
him, and rather reluctantly he scuttled back over the bridge and
jumped up to her knees licking her hands.&nbsp; She said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I look nice, Abner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see nothing wrong with you,&rsquo; said
Abner, without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be soft!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
mean, don&rsquo;t you want to kiss me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t thought about such a
thing.&nbsp; It was she who was being soft now.&nbsp; And yet he
couldn&rsquo;t help wanting to try when he saw her smiling at him
from the stile.&nbsp; He kissed her, very clumsily, on the
cheek.&nbsp; He had never kissed any one before, and its softness
and coolness bewildered him.&nbsp; But she wasn&rsquo;t content
with this.&nbsp; She took his face in both her hands and kissed
his lips.&nbsp; He lost his head.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know what
he was doing.&nbsp; He took her in his <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>arms in a way that was very different
from Mr Bagley&rsquo;s passionate embrace.&nbsp; It seemed as if
he wanted to kiss the life out of her.&nbsp; She drew back,
almost frightened of him, but he wouldn&rsquo;t let her go.&nbsp;
They left Tiger to his rabbits and wandered off into the
woods.&nbsp; When Susan returned in the darkness Mrs Moseley
could not help remarking how well she looked.</p>
<p>This was no more than the beginning of the adventure.&nbsp;
There was nothing lukewarm about the passion that Susan had thus
precipitated.&nbsp; Her education, which had brought her very
nearly to the level of middle-class prudishness, had not prepared
her for Abner&rsquo;s love-making.&nbsp; Mr Bagley, she
reflected, would have made her timid presents of sweets and,
perhaps, occupied the pew behind hers in church.&nbsp; He would
have taken her for walks in one of the decorous parks on the
other side of the city.&nbsp; He would have held her hand on the
tram and paid her spoony compliments.&nbsp; Abner paid her no
compliments, gave her no presents.&nbsp; Nor did he hold her
hand: he held her whole body till she felt that her will was
failing and that her only duty was to obey him.&nbsp; She was
terrified by his violence, ashamed of responding to its
crudity.&nbsp; She was almost sorry that she had provoked him,
for now it was she who fled from him and feared to be overtaken,
and though the excitement of the chase thrilled her she could
never escape from the vague threat of its inevitable end.&nbsp;
Her mother, she knew, would have approved of Mr Bagley.&nbsp;
What would she think of this handsome young labourer, this
professional footballer?&nbsp; She knew that she was bound to
resist him as long as she could.</p>
<p>This was no easy matter.&nbsp; Abner absorbed her, gave her no
chance.&nbsp; Once having got her he would not let her go.&nbsp;
Her calculations of the future didn&rsquo;t trouble him.&nbsp;
Every evening when he had knocked off work he came along to Mrs
Moseley&rsquo;s house and called for her, and in spite of any
excuse that she might make, he took her off over the fields and
into the woods.&nbsp; Mrs Moseley unconsciously abetted him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your mother&rsquo;s anxious that you should get all the
fresh air you can, dear,&rsquo; she used to say, &lsquo;and
it&rsquo;s a beautiful evening.&nbsp; I wish I could go with
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>The old
woman was sure that she could trust them together, and for three
weeks of brilliant summer weather they spent the evening and the
twilight in each other&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Susan tried a series
of tactics that she invented for her own protection.&nbsp; She
pretended to shrink from his coarseness and from the dirt of the
works in contrast with her own clean fragility.&nbsp; She adopted
another, distant attitude, proprietary and maternal.&nbsp; Abner
laughed at both of them.&nbsp; She even, in an extremity, played
her last card: the attentions of the elegant Bagley.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You give him five minutes alone with me, and I&rsquo;ll
settle that!&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re my
wench, and don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Providence, in the shape of a calamity, saved her.&nbsp; Her
mother sprained an ankle in the fowl-pen, and wired for Susan to
return to North Bromwich at once.&nbsp; The telegram came while
Abner was at work, and when he reached Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s
cottage in the evening, Susan was gone.&nbsp; She left a
carefully written note behind her in which she addressed him as
Mr Fellows and said that she hoped he would always think of her
as kindly as she did of him.&nbsp; She said it would be nice to
get back to North Bromwich after so long in the country, but
carefully omitted to supply him with her address.&nbsp; At first
Abner was stunned, then angry.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t put up
with Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s mild meanderings.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t
the heart to go out into the desecrated woods.&nbsp; When Tiger
leapt at him, in anticipation of a walk, he kicked the dog in the
ribs.&nbsp; The football season would not begin for another
month, and since he had nothing to do he returned to
Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages.&nbsp; Alice, who had kept an eye full
of jealous suspicions on him for the last month, received
him.&nbsp; She saw that something had bowled him over.&nbsp; It
gave her a secret satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Early to-night, Abner,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>He would not answer her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever&rsquo;s up with you?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;m all moithered.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, with a
laugh, she answered her own question by another: &lsquo;Too much
sweethearting?&rsquo; in a tone that pretended to be merely
bantering but in reality carried a sting.&nbsp; He knew that
faint touch of malice in her so well that it made him flare up at
once <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>with:
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want no bloody girls.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
didn&rsquo;t strike him that her malice might be taken as a
compliment, and when she laughed at his reply he walked out of
the house in a temper.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know where to go; but taking his
father&rsquo;s example he wandered down to the Royal Oak, where
he sat drinking pint after pint with one of his football friends
and a couple of women.&nbsp; At closing time the whole party were
turned out together and walked down into Halesby.&nbsp; It was
nearly daybreak when he returned to Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages,
still the worse for liquor, and blundered upstairs to bed.&nbsp;
He slept so heavily that he did not hear the Mawne bull in the
morning.&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock a feeling that some one was
in the room aroused him.&nbsp; He opened his eyes to a blinding
light and saw that Alice had placed a cup of hot tea at his
bedside.&nbsp; He drank it so eagerly that he scalded his
mouth.</p>
<h2><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>The
Fifth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> sudden outburst was
sufficiently violent to satisfy Abner that for the present he
could do without liquor or women.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t very
difficult to forget Susan, for she had really been more trouble
than she was worth.&nbsp; The affair would never have begun but
for her provocation, and since she hadn&rsquo;t the pluck to go
through with it, Abner satisfied himself by exaggerating her
insipidity in his own mind.</p>
<p>After the first sting of malice with which she had sent him
off on the drink, Alice showed her repentance, first symbolised
by the waiting cup of tea, in a hundred attentions and
kindnesses.&nbsp; He never told her about his affair with Susan,
but she appeared to understand more or less what had happened and
even to sympathise with him in his violent methods of getting
over it.&nbsp; She made him so comfortable at Hackett&rsquo;s
Cottages that there was no more talk of his finding other
lodgings.&nbsp; In the early days of her married life the
responsibilities of the house and its two male inhabitants had
been too much for her inexperience, and the coming of the baby in
the first year had made her abandon all attempts to keep pace
with domestic demands.&nbsp; In the second year she regained her
strength and a great deal of the physical charm that had
originally attracted John Fellows.&nbsp; The baby, a normal,
healthy child, had also prospered, and now that he was weaned
slept away most of the day on his mother&rsquo;s bed upstairs or
in his cradle in the kitchen.&nbsp; Nothing marred the smoothness
of domestic life at Number Eleven but the uncertainty of John
Fellows&rsquo;s temper and his periodical bouts of drinking; and
even in these emergencies Alice&rsquo;s increasing knowledge of
life and her absorption in the care of Abner and her baby
sustained her.</p>
<p>The strangest part of the whole business was that Abner and
his father never fell foul of one another.&nbsp; Since that one
dangerous moment on the morning of the baby&rsquo;s birth there
had never been any danger of this.&nbsp; <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>It was as if
they had agreed to go on their own ways.&nbsp; Abner kept clear
of his father because his natural love of peace and increasing
concern for the convenience of Alice made him anxious to avoid a
quarrel; and John Fellows condoned his son&rsquo;s unreasonable
abstinence from liquor on the grounds of his success in the
football field.&nbsp; Although he never said so he was proud of
Abner&rsquo;s prowess, gathering indeed a little reflected glory
from it among his mates at the pit and his boon companions at the
pub.</p>
<p>It was fortunate for Alice that her family was so small; for
it meant not only that she was unburdened with housework, but
also that the question of money never troubled her.&nbsp; John
Fellows never did anything by halves.&nbsp; He worked as hard as
he drank, and since all colliers are paid by piecework, he earned
enough to keep the house going and himself in liquor.&nbsp; Abner
also was well paid for the work he did at Mawne, and in addition
to this received a pound a week from the United Football Club
during the season.&nbsp; Out of these earnings he paid Alice
eighteen shillings for his board and keep, and this, together
with her husband&rsquo;s weekly allowance, enabled her to make
the house exactly what she wanted.&nbsp; There seemed to be no
reason why this happy state of affairs should not go on for ever,
or, at any rate, until Abner found some other wretched girl who
took his fancy.&nbsp; This was the event that Alice dreaded most,
and for the present Abner&rsquo;s life was too full of work and
training to make it probable.</p>
<p>They spent most of their evenings together while John Fellows
was down at the Royal Oak and the baby placidly sleeping in its
cradle.&nbsp; They were the happiest of Alice&rsquo;s life, for
they realised all her ideals of what domesticity should be.&nbsp;
The little room was cheerful with firelight and always warm, for
John Fellows had the privilege of buying coal for next to nothing
at the pit.&nbsp; On the table she used to spread a cloth of
bright red chequers.&nbsp; A lamp in the middle of it cast a mild
and homely light.&nbsp; Alice would sit on one side of the fire,
knitting woollen vests for the baby or mending the men&rsquo;s
clothes.&nbsp; She sat in her rocking chair, enthroned with
content, glancing from time to time at <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>the sleeping baby, at the shining
brass, on which she particularly prided herself, at all the
tokens of comfort with which she was surrounded.&nbsp; The door
of Number Eleven was ill-made or warped with age so that a
draught blew in beneath it towards the fire; but Abner had
arranged a curtain of red rep on a running string above it, so
that the draught was not felt and the swaying of the curtain only
emphasised the contrast between the winter without and that
glowing cosiness within.&nbsp; All these things that surrounded
her were her own, her world.&nbsp; She would not have changed one
of them.&nbsp; The glances that she gave to them were proprietary
and richly satisfied.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the same way, she would let her eyes fall on
Abner: a big, loose-limbed fellow, over six feet high, with the
closely cropped hair of the footballer and a yellow
moustache.&nbsp; In the evenings at home he wore no collar and
the firelight played on his powerful neck and lit the fair down
on his arm when he sat in his shirtsleeves.&nbsp; Even with him
her glance was proprietary.&nbsp; He also belonged to her, and
she mended his clothes with the same delight and devotion that
she experienced in making the ridiculous garments of her
son.&nbsp; She rejoiced in his beauty and in his strength.&nbsp;
Perhaps, sometimes, the physical comparison that he suggested
with John Fellows made her admiration more poignant.</p>
<p>Usually these long evenings were lonely.&nbsp; At times,
however, Alice&rsquo;s father, the timekeeper at Mawne, would
come stumping up on his wooden leg and take a seat before the
fire between them.&nbsp; He was very fond of Alice.&nbsp; He
would pinch her cheek and hold her arm and make her blush by
asking every time he came when she was going to give him another
grandson.&nbsp; He was a poor old man.&nbsp; His pay, like most
pensions, was inadequate, and the cottage on the edge of the
works which the company allowed him rent-free was old and so damp
that he suffered from rheumatism, particularly, as he always said
with a chuckle, in the leg that he had lost.&nbsp; Here
Alice&rsquo;s younger sister, Elsie, kept house for him.&nbsp;
She had never been a favourite of his and was a bad
manager.&nbsp; She and her sister, who had always quarrelled
before Alice&rsquo;s marriage, were now, for <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>reasons which
Alice attributed to jealousy, no longer on speaking terms.&nbsp;
Mr Higgins always tried to gloss this unfortunate circumstance
with one of his little jokes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I come up here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Abner ought
to go and keep our Elsie company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner would laugh, but Alice glanced sharply at him.&nbsp; She
hated to hear any woman&rsquo;s name mentioned in connection with
his, and most of all her sister&rsquo;s; but Mr Higgins, unaware
of these fine shades of feeling, constantly pursued the
project.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now if Abner here went and married our
Elsie what a queer kettle of fish it would be to be sure!&nbsp;
Which would you be, his mother or his sister-in-law?&nbsp; Both
on &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Likewise Elsie&rsquo;d be your
daughter-in-law and your sister.&nbsp; And if our Elsie was
Abner&rsquo;s aunt she&rsquo;d be the great-aunt of her own
babbies, surely!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go on so, dad!&rsquo; said Alice,
sharply.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do give over!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can say what you like, Alice,&rsquo; said Mr
Higgins, &lsquo;but that&rsquo;s a knot it&rsquo;d take more than
a parson to get over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At half-past nine the old man would leave them with another of
his little jokes.&nbsp; Abner would see him out, and then,
yawning, stretch his legs and say that it was time he was turning
in.&nbsp; He used to ask Alice, before he went upstairs, if there
was anything he could do for her.&nbsp; It was only a formula,
but the words always gave her a flush of pleasure.&nbsp; When he
was gone upstairs she would busy herself with preparing his can
of tea, and bacon sandwiches to take to the works next day.&nbsp;
Then she would settle down again in her chair at the fireside and
sit with her work in her lap dreaming and waiting for the
unsteady, deliberate step of her husband on the path.&nbsp; This
was the worst moment of her day.</p>
<p>John Fellows rarely returned home until half an hour after
closing time, and for this reason it was seldom that he saw Abner
off the football field.&nbsp; At home he never approached him
except with the hope of extracting inside information as to the
probable results of the league matches on which he proposed to
bet, and in this he found Abner unsympathetic, for <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>although
league football had not sunk in those days to its present depths
of unabashed commercialism, Abner knew that the result of a match
was sometimes decided in accordance with the bookmaker&rsquo;s
instructions.&nbsp; John Fellows never backed horses, for he
regarded the turf as a resort of crooks and sharks.&nbsp; He put
his money on dogs and football teams, and even if he lost it he
had at any rate the satisfaction of seeing it lost with his own
eyes.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t mind losing money as long as he had a
run for it.&nbsp; According to his lights he was a sportsman.</p>
<p>The football season had opened with a flourish as far as Mawne
United were concerned.&nbsp; In the North Bromwich league they
had beaten all their principal rivals, Wolverbury, Dulston, and
even the Albion Reserves.&nbsp; Now, in the semi-final of the
Midland Cup they were to meet the Albion again.&nbsp; The members
of the team became more than ever popular heroes, and Abner, down
at the works, was conscious of his share in the
distinction.&nbsp; The winter had set in early with a November of
black frost that made the scrap-iron with which he was still
engaged under the same grumbling foreman harder and more icy to
the touch, and congealed the grease in the running guide-wheels
of the trolley railway.&nbsp; It was some compensation that the
blast furnaces, which were surrounded in summer by a zone of air
undulant with intolerable heat, now gave a sense of neighbourly
warmth to the centre of the works.</p>
<p>Abner, who knew that his position was more secure than ever,
managed to spend most of his day near these black towers, talking
football to the men who were engaged in making the moulds of sand
into which the molten metal would flow when the furnaces were
tapped.&nbsp; It was an idle and a pleasant life; but he enjoyed
it, knowing, as did every one else in the works, that it was no
more than a preparation for the sterner business of
Saturdays.</p>
<p>One Wednesday, in the middle of the afternoon, he was at work
loading some pigs of iron into a truck that stood waiting on the
siding near the furnace.&nbsp; It was good warm work for a
winter&rsquo;s day, and Abner had <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>thrown off his coat, rolled up his
sleeves, and unfastened the neck of his shirt.&nbsp; He and his
mate had just hoisted the last of the pigs into the truck when
the furnace foreman gave the signal for the tapping of the
nearest tower.&nbsp; Abner watched the proceeding as he put on
his coat and wiped the sweat from his forehead.&nbsp; The men,
stripped to the waist, approached the vent of the furnace
carrying a heavy crowbar with which they loosened the plug of
fireclay which kept the contents of the furnace from
escaping.&nbsp; They leapt aside as the first stream of molten
mineral gushed out.&nbsp; The foreman watched them, shading his
eyes from the heat.&nbsp; The fluid that came first was the dross
of the ore which had sunk to the bottom of the furnace, and this
was diverted so that it flowed into a wide pan where it would
cool into a cake of brittle, iridescent slag.&nbsp; A moment
later pure iron began to flow.&nbsp; The puddlers closed the
entrance to the pool of slag, and molten metal crept, with the
slow persistence of a lava-flow, down the central channel and
into the moulds of sand that were ready to receive it.&nbsp; The
damp air above the beds first steamed, then swam with heat.&nbsp;
Not molten gold could have seemed more beautiful than this harsh,
intractable metal.&nbsp; It ran into the moulds sluggishly and
with a soft, hissing sound.</p>
<p>Some one tapped Abner on the shoulder and drew him
aside.&nbsp; It was Mr Hudson, who had walked down delicately
from the office, so delicately that he had not even disturbed the
two pencils wedged above his ears.&nbsp; He shivered slightly,
for he had been shut up all day with a coke stove.&nbsp; Drawing
Abner aside behind the line of trucks he began to talk to him
about the cup-tie with the Albion.&nbsp; With the utmost
friendliness he discussed the prospects of Mawne United in the
match, which was now only ten days ahead.&nbsp; Abner answered
him respectfully.&nbsp; Mr Hudson had not only given him his
present comfortable job, but also carried in his pocket the
future of every man employed in the works, for Mr Willis, whose
eager mind was always set on expansions of the monster that he
had created out of the fortune which his father-in-law had made
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>in the
Franco-Prussian war, was far too busy to worry his head about
such details.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you think we&rsquo;ll win?&rsquo; said Mr Hudson,
fingering the bronze cross on his watch-chain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It bain&rsquo;t no good playing any match if you
don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll win,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>Mr Hudson stroked his red moustache.&nbsp; &lsquo;I may say
that the Albion has offered us a hundred pounds to play the match
at North Bromwich, on their ground.&nbsp; The club could do with
the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you take it,&rsquo; Abner replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you take it.&nbsp; The Mawne ground&rsquo;s
worth a couple of goals to our chaps in a match of that
kind.&nbsp; That slope down by the Royal Oak puzzled the Albion
last time.&nbsp; Our forwards know how to use it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Albion&rsquo;s particular anxious to win,&rsquo;
said Hudson.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s more, the bookmakers are
giving three to one against Mawne.&nbsp; That shows you which way
the wind&rsquo;s blowing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I hope to God it busts them!&rsquo; said
Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m no friend to football
bookmakers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Hudson blenched at this loose employment of the
deity&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; He took Abner by the arm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;speaking in the
strictest confidence, I can tell you that the club will accept
Albion&rsquo;s offer to play at North Bromwich.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s more, if Albion win, I can safely say it will be
worth ten pounds to you personally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner shook himself free from Mr Hudson&rsquo;s friendly
arm.&nbsp; If he had followed the inclination of the moment he
would have laid Mr Hudson flat there and then on the
cinders.&nbsp; His feelings had passed beyond the stage of
words.&nbsp; But while he stood glaring at Mr Hudson&rsquo;s
face, now weakly smiling and white with fear, he saw something
else that stopped him: the figure of a woman running towards them
as fast as she could over the cumbered ground of the works.&nbsp;
She was hatless and had a shawl thrown round her shoulders.&nbsp;
He knew, even at a distance, that it was Alice.&nbsp; She ran
straight up to Abner, with her hair blown loose and with a flush
of excitement that made her singularly beautiful.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Mr
Hudson snatched at the opportunity for retreat.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
lady wants you,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Abner, still under the influence of a divided emotion, took a
step in his direction, but Alice pulled at his sleeve.&nbsp; The
tears that she had been restraining as she ran overcame her and
she could only cry &lsquo;Abner . . . Abner . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the hell&rsquo;s up with <i>you</i>?&rsquo; he
said roughly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your father, Abner . . .&rsquo; she sobbed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s your father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s he
done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an accident at the pit.&nbsp; Father sent up
Elsie with the message.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean he&rsquo;s dead?&rsquo; said Abner, suddenly
sobered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No . . . not dead. . . .&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
so.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an accident.&nbsp; Some kind of
accident.&nbsp; Elsie was that moithered she couldn&rsquo;t say
proper.&nbsp; So I left her there and ran off for you.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t take him in myself.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t think
of nowt but running for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nell, if he bain&rsquo;t dead what the hell&rsquo;s the
matter?&rsquo; said Abner practically.</p>
<p>They left the works together.&nbsp; Alice, still out of
breath, could scarcely keep pace with Abner&rsquo;s long strides,
but now her nervous sobbing had ceased and she even smiled.&nbsp;
At the corner of Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages they met the procession
from the colliery.&nbsp; For some obscure reason Alice&rsquo;s
father had lost the key of the store in which the stretchers were
kept, and so they carried John Fellows home on a door.&nbsp; In
his progress from the pit they had fallen in with a stream of
children suddenly disgorged from the Ragged Schools, and a train
of these had swollen the <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>, curious to find
out who, or what, lay under the brown blanket.&nbsp; All the
women of Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages gathered at the gateway of
Number Eleven to receive him, many of them carrying babies and
offering haphazard advice in the intervals of giving them
refreshment.&nbsp; The doorway of the house was too small to
admit the improvised stretcher, so they laid it down at the side
of the garden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be careful of my bloody tomatters,&rsquo; John Fellows
growled.&nbsp; It was the first sign of life he had given.&nbsp;
Abner and two others lifted him from the door and <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>carried him
through the kitchen and up the twisting stairs.&nbsp; The boards
creaked under their weight as though they were on the point of
splintering.&nbsp; It was his right thigh that had been broken;
and once, on the journey upstairs, they jolted him so much that
he unclenched his teeth and roared like a bull.&nbsp; The crowd
in the roadway shuddered.&nbsp; This was their first considerable
sensation.</p>
<p>They laid him on the bed.&nbsp; Alice, now very pale and
composed, followed them upstairs with a cup of tea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God! if I&rsquo;m come to tea drinking it&rsquo;s a
gonner,&rsquo; said John Fellows.&nbsp; &lsquo;Send out for a
spot of brandy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A small boy was sent running to the Lyttleton Arms.&nbsp;
Elsie had already gone for the doctor.&nbsp; The news had spread
quickly in various forms, and all Halesby heard with sensation
that John Fellows had had his skull smashed in Mawne pit.&nbsp;
The brandy came.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t have it spoiled with
water and swallowed it neat, but even the brandy could not alter
the ashen pallor of his face beneath its coating of coal
dust.</p>
<p>John Fellows was a hard case and could bear pain or any other
human calamity with fortitude.&nbsp; He lay on his back, gritting
his teeth and squirting the floor with tobacco-juice.&nbsp;
Whenever he spoke it was with a curious dry humour that seldom
appeared in his ordinary conversation.&nbsp; He never complained
of his own sufferings, though he cursed the criminal economy of
the Mawne management in the matter of pit-props.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They might as well use match-sticks as this Norway
stuff.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve put a stopper on my football!&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll see that they pay for
it.&nbsp; I will, and no fear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed they owed him something.&nbsp; The collapse of coal
that had buried him had taken place in a remote gallery on one of
the lower levels of the mine; and though Mr Willis, proud of his
electric lighting and American coal-cutting machinery, was in the
habit of describing Mawne as a drawing-room pit, the arrangements
for salvage were by no means elegant.&nbsp; John Fellows had lain
for three hours beneath a ton or more of coal; and though the
weight of it saved him from <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the pain of movement, acting as a
kind of ponderous splint to the broken limb, the suspense of
waiting till he was dug out would have broken the nerve of a more
sensitive man.&nbsp; From this purgatory he had been hauled to
one of the trolley-lines that traverse the galleries of the pit:
his only moment of relative smoothness between the scene of the
accident and his home being his upward journey in the hoisting
cage.</p>
<p>They waited anxiously for the doctor.&nbsp; The boy made three
more journeys to the Lyttleton Arms for brandy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing that keeps the life in
me,&rsquo; John Fellows said.</p>
<p>In a couple of hours Dr Moorhouse arrived.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sorry
to see you like this, Fellows,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d be sorrier if you was me!&rsquo; Fellows
grunted.</p>
<p>With the help of Alice they split up his trouser leg, and the
doctor manipulated the thigh until he felt the crepitus of the
broken bone.&nbsp; Then he disturbed the patient no longer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a three months&rsquo; job,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t have it seen to properly
here.&nbsp; You want X-rays.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to go into
hospital.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hospital . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; John Fellows cried.</p>
<p>Then, at last, he became fluent.&nbsp; The brandy had
stimulated his imagination even if it had dulled the pain, and he
launched into an uncompromising statement of the opinions with
which poor people regard the institutions that are erected for
their care.&nbsp; He made it plain that <i>he</i>, at any rate,
wasn&rsquo;t going to die in any hospital, or be pulled about by
any students, and not a spot of drink.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to die in any hospital,&rsquo;
the doctor said.&nbsp; He was painfully used to this kind of
outburst.&nbsp; It was always a long and bitter controversy, and
it always ended, as he knew well, in submission.&nbsp; While John
Fellows was fuming he fixed him up on a temporary splint and then
went home to telephone for the ambulance.&nbsp; At the foot of
the stairs his eyes fell on the patient face of Mrs Moseley, who
had driven up on the cart of a friendly baker as soon as she
heard the news.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You here again!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Upon my
word a lunatic asylum&rsquo;s the place for you.&nbsp; Take your
leg out of my sight.&nbsp; I never want to see it again.&nbsp; I
wash my hands <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>of you!&rsquo;&nbsp; He went off grumbling, and Mrs
Moseley climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>It pleased John Fellows to see her.&nbsp; Indeed, from the
moment of her arrival, he would not let any one else touch
him.&nbsp; In the old days Alice would have been jealous; but
hardship and difficulty had so changed her nature that she even
concerned herself with Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s comfort.&nbsp; The old
woman moved about the room like a soothing influence, and when,
an hour later, the ambulance arrived, she insisted on
accompanying her old friend to the infirmary at North
Bromwich.&nbsp; John Fellows went off cheerfully, with a quartern
of brandy in his coat pocket.&nbsp; He was even bright enough to
joke with Mr Higgins, who now arrived on the scene, having just
discovered the key of the stretcher-store in his hip-pocket.</p>
<p>John Fellows&rsquo;s removal to hospital made no great
difference to any one but Alice.&nbsp; To her the relief was
enormous, for it not only saved her the trouble of irregular
meals, allowing her to devote her days to her baby, but freed her
nights from, at the best, uncertainty, and, at the worst,
terror.&nbsp; Now, when Abner had said good-night to her, she
need no longer sit with her nerves on edge, waiting for Fellows
to come home, wondering what would be the humour of his
entrance.&nbsp; Instead of this she now sat over the fire for
half an hour of luxurious drowsiness, then picked up the baby and
went off placidly to bed.</p>
<p>Of course she had to go easy with her housekeeping
expenditure, for all John Fellows&rsquo;s club pay would be
absorbed in paying for tobacco and other luxuries, such as
butter, which the hospital did not provide for its patients, but
Abner, as soon as he realised this, told her that she could count
on the pound a week that he earned from the football club, and
more, if necessary, for during the last year he had found it
possible to put by a few sovereigns for himself.&nbsp; Alice did
not find it necessary, however, to draw on his reserves.&nbsp;
Her own tastes were simple and Abner was easily pleased.&nbsp;
Indeed, John Fellows had always been the most expensive member of
the household.</p>
<p>Abner was now in strict training for the cup-tie with <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the Albion
and went to bed early every night.&nbsp; The Mawne directors, as
Mr Hudson had foretold, jumped at the big club&rsquo;s offer to
play the match at North Bromwich, tempted not only by the welcome
hundred pounds but by the prospect of an even bigger share of
gate-money.&nbsp; The team went through their training with the
greatest earnestness.&nbsp; Every afternoon they turned out on
the Mawne ground practising passing, shooting, and tactics,
followed by the eyes of the trainer, an international long since
retired, who walked about the field carrying always a black bag
that contained lemons, elastic bandages, and a patent embrocation
of his own that smelt like Elliman&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Nobody who saw these men at practice could possibly have
suspected that they thought of anything but winning their match,
though each of them must have known that all the others had been
offered ten pounds a head to lose it.&nbsp; In the dressing-room,
where they stood rubbing each other down with flesh-gloves in the
clouds of steam that the cold air condensed from half a dozen tin
baths of hot water, they talked of plans and prospects just as if
no shadow of corruption had ever approached them.&nbsp; Nobody
had mentioned the subject to Abner since Hudson had tackled him
at the works.&nbsp; That, no doubt, was the policy of those who
had put up the money: to let the thought of it sink in over a
period of ten days and trust to the frailty of human nature on
the eleventh.&nbsp; They knew their business, for the mere
presence of such a disturbing problem was enough to demoralise
the team.</p>
<p>On the day before the match the Mawne goalkeeper sprained his
ankle at practice, and neither the bandages nor the embrocation
of the trainer could restore him.&nbsp; In this emergency the
committee called upon George Harper, who had retired four or five
years before and was now a man of substance and landlord of a
public-house, to take his place.&nbsp; Abner, who had always been
on good terms with this idol of his boyhood, went up to him after
the last practice game and told him of Hudson&rsquo;s
offer.&nbsp; Harper listened to him in silence, nodding his head,
but when Abner asked him if he too had been approached by Hudson,
he only laughed.&nbsp; <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>&lsquo;Hudson?&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;that red-whiskered b&mdash;?&nbsp; No fear of that!&nbsp;
He dursen&rsquo;t come near me.&nbsp; He knows what he&rsquo;d
get, does Mr Hudson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this, when the team were assembled in the
dressing-room of the Albion ground on the day of the cup-tie,
Abner saw the trainer take George Harper aside.&nbsp; He talked
excitedly in a low voice, but Harper only went red in the face
and said nothing.&nbsp; As they left the dressing-room Abner
winked at George, and George, solemnly, winked back at him.&nbsp;
The captain kicked the ball into the middle of the field, and the
Mawne team ran out after him, amid a spreading uproar of
cheers.</p>
<p>The turf of the Albion ground was incredibly smooth and level
after the rough field in which they were accustomed to play at
Mawne.&nbsp; The place was, indeed, a vast oval amphitheatre,
with high stands rising above the dressing-rooms on the west and
on every other side a sloping embankment so packed with people
that the ground on which they stood could nowhere be seen.&nbsp;
The vastness of this white-faced multitude was imposing in its
ugliness.&nbsp; Its pale, restless masses, represented on a
horrible scale the grimy flatness of the city complexion.&nbsp;
From the crowd a low murmur arose like the noise of the sea
breaking on distant shingles, and over all its surface floated a
fume of tobacco smoke.&nbsp; A moment later the Albion team
emerged; the crowd swayed, and the murmur swelled to a roar of
welcome.&nbsp; The chocolate and yellow jerseys of Mawne so
nearly resembled the Albion&rsquo;s colours that the home team
turned out in white shirts and knickers.&nbsp; It was partly the
spotlessness of this attire that made them seem like a company of
athletic giants, swifter, more flexible and stronger than their
opponents.&nbsp; Even Abner&rsquo;s six feet were dwarfed by the
diverse colours of his clothes.&nbsp; It seemed a ridiculous
thing to match this shabby team of stunted pitmen with eleven
picked athletes.</p>
<p>The game began.&nbsp; Almost at once the white line of the
Albion forwards was in motion.&nbsp; It was a lovely sight, a
lesson in fleetness, elasticity and precision.&nbsp; The Albion,
taking no risks, had included a number of <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>their first
league players in the team, and it looked as if Mawne must be
nowhere.&nbsp; Abner, at centre half, the pivotal position of the
whole field, felt that he could do no more than play a spoiling
game against this perfect machine.&nbsp; In the back of his mind
he knew also that a certain number, probably the majority of the
Mawne players, were not anxious to win.&nbsp; It is not easy,
however, to play deliberately a losing game, or indeed to play
football with any degree of deliberation.&nbsp; The heat of the
game seemed to inspire the Mawne team to a stubborn, almost
desperate, defence.&nbsp; As a last barrier to the Albion attacks
he knew that George Harper, even if he were an old stager, was
incorruptible; and George Harper, in his prime, had never played
a more marvellous game.&nbsp; Perhaps the feeling that he
belonged to an older and more gifted generation of footballers
helped him.&nbsp; Time after time, when the Albion forwards came
swinging down the field in a perfect crescent, he saved the Mawne
goal.&nbsp; His play was inspired, and when half-time came, no
goal had been scored.&nbsp; The players stood sweating in the
dressing-room.&nbsp; The trainer handed round cut lemons.&nbsp;
Once again Abner saw him approach George Harper and take him by
the sleeve; but this time the goalkeeper pushed him away.&nbsp;
Mr Willis came down into the dressing-room to congratulate the
players.&nbsp; He was smoking a big cigar, and evidently
immensely pleased with himself.&nbsp; He, at any rate, was above
suspicion.&nbsp; The referee called the players out again.</p>
<p>In the second half Abner worked as he had never worked
before.&nbsp; The Mawne team was tiring; play grew scrappy and
spiteful; but though the Albion players could do what they liked
with the ball in midfield, they did not seem able to score.&nbsp;
Even if Mawne were equally ineffective it seemed probable that
the match would end in a draw.&nbsp; The Albion crowd grew
restless, and began to think that the referee was favouring their
opponents.&nbsp; The Albion players, now a little rattled, tried
to effect by roughness what they could not achieve by
skill.&nbsp; Several free-kicks were given against them for
fouls, and the crowd began to boo the referee.&nbsp; It was like
the hollow voice of some sullen ocean-monster.&nbsp; <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>The Albion,
encouraged by the support of the crowd, pursued these
tactics.&nbsp; Two men were ordered off for fighting.&nbsp; A
moment later the crowd regained its good humour stimulated by the
sight of a shot from the Albion centre-forward that hit the
cross-bar above George Harper&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; If the shot had
been three inches lower he could not possibly have saved
it.&nbsp; The kick that followed transferred the play to the
other end of the field.&nbsp; It was close on time and everybody
was nervous.&nbsp; A centre from the Mawne outside right came to
Abner&rsquo;s feet in front of the Albion goal.&nbsp; One of the
Albion backs tried to trip him, getting cleverly on the blind
side of the referee.&nbsp; Abner stumbled free, and since the
goal was now open, the player lashed out at his ear.&nbsp;
Abner&rsquo;s temper was up.&nbsp; He left the ball and closed
with his opponent.&nbsp; The Mawne team held up their hands and
called on the referee like one man.&nbsp; A violent fight had
begun when the referee arrived, shaking himself free from a
gesticulating escort of Mawne players.&nbsp; The Albion men
separated the fighters, and though the referee warned both of
them that if anything more happened he would send them off, he
gave a free kick to Mawne.&nbsp; The crowd howled.&nbsp; It
seemed for a moment as if they would burst their barriers and
swarm on to the field.&nbsp; Very grimly, his face streaming with
blood, Abner took the kick.&nbsp; The Albion goalkeeper, making a
high save, tipped the ball over the cross-bar.&nbsp; A
corner.&nbsp; The players lined up, panting, in front of the
Albion goal.&nbsp; The young outside right, whose centre had been
the beginning of the trouble, took the kick.&nbsp; The ball
sailed high and fell slowly into the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of
players.&nbsp; Abner, who had proved his dangerousness, was
carefully marked and charged at as the ball fell, but he butted
his opponent aside, and making full use of his superior height,
managed to head it into the top left-hand corner of the
net.&nbsp; A shout of &lsquo;goal&rsquo; rose from the crowd, but
there was no applause.&nbsp; The strange thing about the whole
business was the attitude of the Mawne players.&nbsp; These men,
who had been playing a half-hearted game all afternoon, appeared
to be overwhelmed with joy.&nbsp; They ran up to Abner and shook
both his hands as if <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>there had been no matter of ten
pounds depending on his achievement.&nbsp; Even George Harper
came running down the field and patted him on the back.&nbsp;
George had his work cut out, for in the last three minutes of the
game the Albion made a desperate effort to equalise, and
subjected him to an incessant bombardment.&nbsp; Luck aided his
skill, and when the whistle went for time Mawne had won their
match.</p>
<p>Abner went home that night with a thick ear and a slowly
closing right eye.&nbsp; He was tired and sore but elated.&nbsp;
He wanted to do nothing but sit in front of the fire and think
over again the progress of the match.&nbsp; Alice, on the other
hand, was terribly concerned with his injuries.&nbsp; She dressed
his face with some ointment that Mrs Moseley had recommended her
for the baby, and sat opposite to him burning with pain and
indignation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you&rsquo;d give it up, Abner,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;One of these days you&rsquo;ll get
killed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s downright brutal.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worse
than prize-fighting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what it was,&rsquo; Abner chuckled.</p>
<p>He pretended that he didn&rsquo;t want her to fuss over him;
but all the same this devotion was very pleasant.&nbsp; As for
Alice, the pain of seeing him so battered was almost equalled by
her pleasure in tending him.&nbsp; And they were alone.&nbsp; She
was thankful that they were alone.&nbsp; Time after time she
returned to her pleading that he would give up football.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve never come home in a state like this,&rsquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give up football?&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
what would we live on then?&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t manage, and
that&rsquo;s straight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d do it,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;d manage somehow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed at her intensity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret
yourself about me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m all
right.&rsquo;&nbsp; He went to bed and slept like a log.&nbsp;
She brought him breakfast and clean dressings to his bedroom.</p>
<p>On Monday morning down at the works Mr Willis met him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good lad!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good
lad!&rsquo;&nbsp; Later in the day Mr Hudson came down from the
office to the place where he was working.&nbsp; He smiled to
conceal his annoyance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I suppose we&rsquo;ve
got to thank you and Harper for the win,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&lsquo;I reckon we&rsquo;ve not got to thank you!&rsquo;
Abner replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rsquo; said
Hudson.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better go up to the pay-office
for your money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Time enough when I&rsquo;ve finished,&rsquo; said
Abner.&nbsp; Football always prevented him from collecting his
pay on a Saturday morning with the other men.&nbsp; At the end of
the day he went to the pay clerk.&nbsp; Instead of twenty-five
shillings as usual he was given fifty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s this for?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lieu of a week&rsquo;s notice,&rsquo; said the
clerk.&nbsp; &lsquo;The gaffer says we have to cut down.&nbsp; Mr
Hudson&rsquo;s orders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;B&mdash;r Hudson!&rsquo; said Abner angrily.</p>
<h2><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>The
Sixth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night he went down to the
public-house for the first time since the day of Susan&rsquo;s
defection more than a year before.&nbsp; The crowd at the Royal
Oak were glad to see him, for they were still talking about
nothing else but the result of the cup-tie.&nbsp; Every one was
anxious to treat him and to condole with him on his black eye,
and he was prepared to drink as much as they would give him,
standing his own share up to the limit of the fifty shillings in
his pocket, as long as he could forget the anger with which he
had left the works.&nbsp; If he didn&rsquo;t, somehow, get the
idea of his injury out of his mind, he felt that he would
probably go down to Hudson&rsquo;s private house and wring his
neck.</p>
<p>In the Royal Oak, drinking nothing but hot whisky, he managed
to lose himself and the troubles of the day.&nbsp; He was
conscious of nothing but the warmth and comfort of the private
bar, the dark varnished walls, the polished beer engine, the
shining rows of bottles, the crackle of the bright fire.&nbsp;
For a time the room was also full of jolly people who laughed and
spoke with loud, buoyant voices, the happiest company
imaginable.&nbsp; The spirituous air was exhilarating and endowed
all the contents of the bar, from the postage stamps on the
ceiling to the brass spittoons and sawdust of the floor, with a
quality of unusual vividness.&nbsp; At last this curious clarity
faded and the details that had seemed for some curious reason
exciting, became blurred.&nbsp; Abner tucked up his feet on a
settle covered with American leather and tried to go to
sleep.&nbsp; When he awoke, his old friend Joe Hodgetts was
piloting him home along the Stourton Road under a sky of dancing
stars.</p>
<p>Alice was waiting up for him.&nbsp; Supper was laid on the
table and she rose from her chair by the fire to welcome him as
he entered.&nbsp; The new light dazzled him, and as he stood
uncertainly at the door he took hold of the red curtain to steady
himself, and, lurching, <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>pulled it down from its string.&nbsp;
Alice gave a cry.&nbsp; Even though she knew the symptoms well
enough in her husband she couldn&rsquo;t believe that Abner was
drunk.&nbsp; She only saw him standing there with the great
discoloured bruise on his flushed face.&nbsp; He held the curtain
in his hand and looked at it stupidly, as if he didn&rsquo;t know
what to do with it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner . . . what&rsquo;s up with you?&rsquo; she said,
running to take it from him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nowt up with me,&rsquo; he said
solemnly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m drunk.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; If any one&rsquo;s a right to be drunk it&rsquo;s
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The equanimity with which she had trained herself to receive
John Fellows in such circumstances deserted her.&nbsp; She knew
perfectly well that it was no use arguing with a drunken man, but
the case of Abner was so exceptional that she began to do
so.&nbsp; He took no notice of her, and then she rated him
violently, so that overcome by a sudden flush of anger he took
hold of her arms as if he were going to throw her down.&nbsp; He
had never taken hold of her like that before.&nbsp; She faced
him, panting for breath, and they stared into each other&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; He felt the warmth of her arms through the sleeve of
her bodice and realised her for the first time as a living,
warm-blooded creature.&nbsp; She trembled under his gaze, but did
not try to free herself.&nbsp; He felt that something like this
had happened before; remembered Susan.&nbsp; Suddenly sobered,
almost frightened, he relaxed his grip on her arms.&nbsp; Still
she did not move.&nbsp; She stood dazed, with her breath coming
and going.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; He staggered to the foot of the stairs and left her
standing there.</p>
<p>When he had gone she pulled herself together and put her hands
to her eyes as though she wanted to shut out what she had
seen.&nbsp; She had forgotten her first resentment and the
emotion with which she trembled now was one that frightened her
and put her to shame.&nbsp; She felt that she had just
experienced the most thrilling moment of her life.&nbsp; After
that she could never pretend to herself that she was not in love
with Abner.</p>
<p>In the morning he woke early.&nbsp; Before Alice knew that he
was astir he went downstairs in his stockinged <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>feet and lit
the kitchen fire.&nbsp; By the time that she herself appeared he
had made himself a cup of tea and laid the table for
breakfast.&nbsp; Neither of them spoke of his violent homecoming
the night before or of the stranger scene that followed it.&nbsp;
She had half expected that he would ask her pardon for what had
happened, but such a proceeding didn&rsquo;t seem to him
important.&nbsp; He had been drunk, now he was sober, and that
was the end of the matter.&nbsp; When breakfast was over he went
out into the dank washhouse and shaved.&nbsp; She was puzzled to
see that he was not going to work, for he had dressed in his
Sunday clothes and wore his watch-chain, decorated with a couple
of silver football medals.&nbsp; At last she plucked up courage
to ask him if he was not going to Mawne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I bain&rsquo;t going
there no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Got the sack,&rsquo; he said laconically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the money . . .&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I picked up two weeks&rsquo; pay last night.&nbsp; You
can have what&rsquo;s left.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned out his pockets and gave her a handful of small
change.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s more than I reckoned
there&rsquo;d be,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She threw down the money on the table and stared at him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I owe more nor this!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
about the football money?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about football,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done with football as long as that
Hudson&rsquo;s on the committee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The situation baffled her.&nbsp; Money they must have, and she
was quick to rack her brains for some way in which it could be
got.&nbsp; An inspiration came to her.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
didn&rsquo;t ought to work with your eye in that state,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Better go down to the doctor&rsquo;s and
put yourself on the box.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been paying into that
club long enough and not had a penny out of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Club?&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
sponge on no clubs!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going down to the pit to see
the doggy.&nbsp; I reckon he&rsquo;ll find me a job
underground.&rsquo;&nbsp; He lit his pipe and went out into the
frosty morning.&nbsp; A delayed impulse made her want to give him
his knitted <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>neck-scarf, but it came too late.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
know what to make of it.&nbsp; In a single night all the
pleasant, ordered happiness of the life that they had been
leading since John Fellows&rsquo;s accident had been
overwhelmed.&nbsp; She felt it unreasonable, incredible, that
this should have happened.&nbsp; She could not even solace
herself with the care of her baby, who was now beginning to
babble and to stagger with uncertain steps from chair to
chair.&nbsp; She found herself wishing, for a moment, that there
wasn&rsquo;t a kid to worry about, and was as quickly bitten with
remorse, for she knew that the baby was her most precious
possession on earth.&nbsp; She could settle down to
nothing.&nbsp; The foundations of her routine life had been
dissolved.&nbsp; She had not even money enough to meet the bills
that she always paid on Mondays.&nbsp; But the thought of money
was nothing to her compared with her anxiety as to Abner&rsquo;s
attitude toward herself.&nbsp; She found a little comfort in
thinking that he had not yet recovered from the effects of his
debauch, and that when he returned in the evening they might take
up their relation at the point where it had been so abruptly
convulsed.&nbsp; On this her whole happiness depended.</p>
<p>Abner&rsquo;s visit to the pit was satisfactory in so far as
it procured him without the least difficulty a job
underground.&nbsp; He was a trained miner, and in those days,
when the output of the mine had been diminished by a series of
accidents and a growing tendency to work short time, any new hand
was welcome at Mawne pit.&nbsp; When he came back in the evening
he reassured Alice that even if they had to go easy in the matter
of expenditure they need not starve in the interval before John
Fellows returned to double their income.&nbsp; To meet the
present emergency he handed her the sovereign that he had
received from the football club.&nbsp; &lsquo;If that sod Hudson
had had his way you&rsquo;d have had ten,&rsquo; he said
enigmatically.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better send a nipper to
the Oak with my boots and football gear,&rsquo; he told
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done with Mawne United.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was thankful for his solution of her money difficulties,
for pride would not have allowed her to face the butcher and the
grocer without the money <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>in her hand.&nbsp; In spite of the
loss that it implied, she couldn&rsquo;t reasonably refuse to be
glad that he had abandoned football since she had so often begged
him to do so.&nbsp; What troubled her far more than this was the
fact that his attitude toward her was changed.&nbsp; It was clear
that he had not been too drunk to realise the significance of the
moment when he had held her in his arms and they had looked into
each other&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; He had seen the emotional
precipice on the edge of which they were standing.&nbsp; Well, so
had she; but that seemed to her no reason why they should not
pretend that things were as they had always been.&nbsp; She was
content to play her part; even, for their common comfort, to
forget what had happened.&nbsp; The only thing that she could not
bear was that he should avoid her as though she were an evil
thing to be feared and distrusted.</p>
<p>This, in effect, was what he did.&nbsp; To drink habitually
was not in his nature.&nbsp; When he drank he did so simply as a
means to escape from himself or from some harassing emotion; and
so he did not seek a refuge, as she had feared he would, in a
public house.&nbsp; None the less it soon became clear that the
pleasant homely evenings at Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages were now at
an end.&nbsp; The chair which Alice always arranged for him at
the fireside was never occupied.&nbsp; When he came home from the
pit at night and had washed himself in the scullery he now went
out again to spend the evenings with his friends, with old Mr
Higgins, with George Harper, or with Mrs Moseley.&nbsp; He hated
his work at the colliery: the dark, cramped labour in remote
subterranean stalls was a terrible change from his free and easy
life at the furnaces.&nbsp; He hated the dirt no less than the
darkness and it scarcely mended matters to realise that he was
wanted at the pit.</p>
<p>Opportunities of escape soon presented themselves.&nbsp; The
retirement of their most promising player from the United team
created a sensation not only in Mawne but in the surrounding
towns.&nbsp; Abner would give no explanation for it.&nbsp; When
people asked him why he was not playing for Mawne he merely told
them to go and ask Hudson.&nbsp; It was impossible for him to
change <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>his
team in the middle of the season without an official
transfer.&nbsp; The secretary of the Albion made a special
journey to Halesby to ask him to consent to this; but since this
proceeding would have presented the Mawne club with a handsome
transfer fee, he refused.&nbsp; The Albion offered him good and
easy work in North Bromwich if he would sign on for them next
season.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can have it for the asking,&rsquo; they
said&mdash;but he refused, for though he would have liked nothing
better he felt that it would be wrong to desert Alice in her
present emergency.&nbsp; Until his father returned it was his
duty to stay with her.</p>
<p>The winter wore on, and John Fellows, whose alcoholic history
made him a bad subject for a fractured thigh-bone, still lay in
hospital.&nbsp; Abner stuck to his thankless labours at the
pit.&nbsp; He worked longer underground than he need have done,
simply for the reason that he did not want to spend his evenings
in the dangerous company of Alice.&nbsp; After that night he knew
that he could not wholly trust himself.&nbsp; His earnings were
now sufficient to keep the household in comfort, and the money
that he drew from his overtime he put aside for an emergency,
concealing them in an old stocking underneath the mattress of his
bed.&nbsp; He wanted to be sure of his liberty as soon as his
father returned.</p>
<p>At Christmas, Alice made a heroic attempt to recover her lost
happiness.&nbsp; A week before the festival she went down into
the market at Halesby and bought a branch of berried holly which
she hung above the middle of the table from a nail that had once
supported a hanging lamp.&nbsp; She decorated the branch with
cheap trifles, flags, lustred balls and candles of coloured wax
in metal clips shaped like butterflies.&nbsp; Over the
mantelpiece she pinned a scroll of varnished paper with
&lsquo;God Bless Our Home&rsquo; in gothic characters upon it,
and in various inaccessible places she put sprigs of
mistletoe.&nbsp; Although she said nothing to Abner it was
evident that she was counting on him to celebrate the feast at
home.&nbsp; A few days before the event she showed him a present
that she had bought for the child, a wooden horse with red
nostrils, a lambskin mane, and a ridiculous dab of a tail.&nbsp;
Even this failed to move him, and up to the last moment she was
in doubt as to whether he would forsake her.&nbsp; <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>She schemed
her very hardest to keep him, using as a bait the child whose
curious ways and stumbling attempts at speech amused him.&nbsp;
This creature loved, above all things, to be caught up and
perched on the dizzy height of Abner&rsquo;s shoulder, so high
that he was able to examine the unexplored country of the
ceiling.&nbsp; He also loved to play with Tiger, who now came and
went in Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages of his own accord.&nbsp; Tiger
liked children, and he and little John would roll over together
on the kitchen floor.&nbsp; Alice always made the dog welcome,
tempting him with such bones as never entered Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; He was a link with Abner, and therefore to be
encouraged.</p>
<p>In the end Abner spent Christmas Day at Hackett&rsquo;s
Cottages, or, to be exact, the morning and evening of it, for the
afternoon he devoted to watching the league match between Mawne
United and Dulston on the Royal Oak ground.&nbsp; He could not
bring himself to forget football altogether even though he
persisted in his determination not to play.&nbsp; In spite of all
Alice&rsquo;s pathetic efforts, the day was not a success.&nbsp;
In the evening, when they sat over the fire and Mr Higgins, who
had brought in a basket of oranges, had left them alone together,
she made a direct attempt to have the matter out with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why are you so funny with me, Abner?&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done that
you should treat me distant like this.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t use
to do it.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he would not answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve took a turn against me,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you have.&nbsp; What is it I&rsquo;ve
done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>You</i> ain&rsquo;t done nothing,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And <i>I</i> ain&rsquo;t took a turn
again&rsquo; you neither.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all right if so be
you&rsquo;ll leave me alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yo&rsquo;m different even with our John,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; bother,&rsquo; he said at
last.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be different time ourn comes
back.&nbsp; He must be getting on a bit now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had to leave it at that.&nbsp; It had been a difficult
evening for Abner, for in spite of her troubles the firelight and
the excitement that the baby&rsquo;s pleasure in his presents had
given her made her look very attractive in her own fragile
way.&nbsp; &lsquo;When ourn comes back . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; She
sighed, for she felt that John <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Fellows&rsquo;s return would put an
end even to the small measure of happiness that she managed to
extract from the present.&nbsp; When John Fellows came back she
would be faced with all the old desperate problems, the old
terrible nights.&nbsp; As they sat over the fire she turned her
face aside to hide the tears that came into her eyes.&nbsp; Abner
puffed stolidly at his pipe.&nbsp; &lsquo;When he comes
back,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll have a look
round for another job.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; she asked, in alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, anywhere out of this place,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sick of Halesby.&nbsp; I reckon I&rsquo;ll go to
Coventry or Wales.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s good money in
Wales.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Abner,
you&rsquo;m not going to leave me?&nbsp; Not with him. . .
.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t abide it, Abner.&nbsp; Abner, if you
leave me, I&rsquo;ll make a hole in the cut, God strike me if I
won&rsquo;t!&rsquo;&nbsp; She could contain herself no longer and
went sobbing upstairs.&nbsp; Abner found it difficult to resist
an impulse to follow her and comfort her.&nbsp; He was not used
to a woman&rsquo;s tears.&nbsp; He got as far as the foot of the
stairs, then slowly turned back and sat on, smoking till midnight
amid the pathetic decorations of that poor room.&nbsp; His
reflections determined him more than ever to cut himself free
from the embarrassments of life at Halesby.&nbsp; Coventry was
almost too near.&nbsp; Yes, he would go down into Wales.&nbsp; On
his way upstairs he listened for a moment outside her bedroom
door.&nbsp; He thought he heard her still sobbing under the
sheets, but when he listened the sound of sobbing stopped.</p>
<p>Next day she had quite regained her self-possession.&nbsp;
They went together, taking the baby with them, to visit John
Fellows in the North Bromwich Infirmary.&nbsp; They found him
lying in a long, clean ward festooned with Christmas
decorations.&nbsp; The ominous erection of an apparatus of
weights and pulleys at the foot of his bed emphasised his
helplessness.&nbsp; He did not appear to be very pleased to see
them, and his embraces so frightened the baby that he set up a
howl.&nbsp; The baby need not have been frightened, for John
Fellows was far less impressive than he had been in his former
state.&nbsp; The whole man seemed to have shrunk.&nbsp; He <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>was newly
shaved; his rough hands had become clean and almost transparent;
but though he now looked as if he couldn&rsquo;t hurt any one,
the presence of the visitors set him grumbling at once.&nbsp;
From the first he appeared to be offended with Abner because he
had not thought to smuggle in any liquor for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t brought a spot,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a b&mdash;y fine son!&rsquo;&nbsp; Even
three months of abstinence had not diminished his craving.&nbsp;
He told them that he dreamed of liquor, but that there seemed to
be no chance of him getting any nearer to it than in dreams, for,
as far as he could see, his leg was exactly as it had been when
he came into hospital.&nbsp; After this outburst of discontent he
softened a little, pinched Alice&rsquo;s cheek, played a little
with the baby, who had by this time overcome his fears, and even
talked to Abner about football.&nbsp; In this way he heard the
story of the Albion match and Mawne committee&rsquo;s attempt to
square the players.&nbsp; At first he was enthusiastic about
George Harper&rsquo;s resistance to the corrupting influence; but
on second thoughts he disapproved of it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon
you and George done your mates a bad turn.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t
every day you can pick up ten pound for nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
only thing that modified his opinion was the dislike that he
shared with all the other men at Mawne of Hudson.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hudson . . .&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish
you&rsquo;d a&rsquo; finished him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>While Abner and his father were talking football Alice had
approached the sister, a dark, capable-looking woman whose
features and hair and eyes were as rigid and sharp and metallic
as the scissors hanging from her starched belt, on the subject of
John Fellows&rsquo;s progress.&nbsp; This woman stared at her for
a moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you Fellows&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sister, I&rsquo;m his wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s the worst grumbler we&rsquo;ve ever had in
this ward,&rsquo; said the sister; &lsquo;but as a matter of fact
he&rsquo;s getting on finely.&nbsp; The doctor says the bone is
set nicely, and he should be out in a couple of weeks now.&nbsp;
I expect they&rsquo;ll send him out on a Thomas&rsquo;s
splint.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what that is,&rsquo; she
added, with a rather scornful intonation, but then, noticing that
Alice looked tired, she took her into her bunk and gave her a cup
of tea.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t imagine that you were
Fellows&rsquo;s wife,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and this his
baby.&nbsp; I thought your husband was the young man who came
with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He and baby&rsquo;s half-brothers,&rsquo; Alice
explained, blushing.&nbsp; &lsquo;By Mr Fellows&rsquo;s first
wife, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ll be happy,&rsquo; replied the
sister doubtfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time the visitors were
going.&nbsp; Is Fellows a very heavy drinker?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he is,&rsquo; said Alice mildly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought so,&rsquo; said the sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
ought to keep him in here for your sake.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s
always a rush on surgical beds at Christmas time.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d better call your stepson.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>The
Seventh Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> was genuinely relieved when
Alice told him the good report that the sister had given her on
his father&rsquo;s condition, for it promised him a speedy
release from the discomfort of the situation.&nbsp; Alice, who
had accustomed herself to examine every shade of expression that
he showed, knew that he was rejoicing at the prospect of leaving
her.&nbsp; The thought piqued her, for she had forced herself
always to behave toward him exactly as if there had never been a
moment of embarrassment between them.&nbsp; Her pride would not
let the matter rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s coming back,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad his leg&rsquo;s joined, if that&rsquo;s
what you mean,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s only
human-like.&nbsp; Besides, it&rsquo;s best for
everybody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what about me?&rsquo; she asked, passionately.</p>
<p>He would not answer, and she flowed on with a stream of
reproaches, telling him that she knew he hated her and
couldn&rsquo;t bear the sight of her, in the hope that he would
be driven to say that he did nothing of the sort.&nbsp; Abner
remained passive.&nbsp; He knew very well that if he were to lose
his temper with her the situation might easily become just as
dangerous as if he were tender.&nbsp; The main thing to be
avoided with her was emotion of any kind.&nbsp; Life had been
made difficult enough for him already simply because he knew that
their relation was capable of passionate developments.&nbsp; He
knew what passion was, and in spite of himself he could not
always banish the thought of Alice from his mind.&nbsp; Admitting
this, he had mapped out a course of conduct for himself, and he
meant to stick to it until the happy day of his relief.</p>
<p>It was not a fortnight but a month before John Fellows left
the hospital.&nbsp; He came back, as the sister had anticipated,
with a Thomas&rsquo;s splint on his thigh and instructions to
attend the infirmary as an <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>out-patient in another month&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; The splint was an embarrassment that he resented, for
it compelled him to sit in an uncomfortable position with the
right leg extended, but it did not prevent him walking or
drinking, and as soon as he had mastered the first of these
processes he lost no time in making up for his long abstinence
from the second.&nbsp; The rules of the friendly society to which
he belonged forbade its members to visit public-houses as long as
they were receiving sick pay, so that the invalid was forced to
enter the Lyttleton Arms by a back door which he reached by
crossing the garden of a friend, and having once solved this
problem Fellows managed to put in the day without any
difficulty.</p>
<p>Every Friday morning he hobbled down on his crutches to the
doctor&rsquo;s surgery and obtained a certificate by means of
which he drew his weekly pay.&nbsp; It was only twelve shillings
a week, and he never parted with a penny of it to Alice, so that
the household now depended entirely on Abner&rsquo;s
earnings.&nbsp; It puzzled both of them to imagine how he managed
to live in a state of fuddled alcoholism on this small sum.&nbsp;
They supposed that his old friend the landlord, trusting him, put
it on the slate in the hope of being paid when Fellows went back
to work.&nbsp; He had always been free with his money, and no
doubt his boon companions of the past were ready to treat him as
often as they could afford it.</p>
<p>At the end of February he went in to North Bromwich in
accordance with the hospital orders and returned without his
splint.&nbsp; The doctors had told him that it would now be wise
to use the leg as much as possible and suggested that the
colliery authorities, who were partly responsible for the
accident, should now give him a light job at the pit-head.&nbsp;
John Fellows, however, didn&rsquo;t see the point of this.&nbsp;
He had paid into the Loyal United Free Gardeners for more than
thirty years and now that he had the chance he meant to get some
of his money back by staying on the box as long as they would let
him.&nbsp; He could get quite enough exercise for his leg in his
clandestine approaches to the Lyttleton Arms.&nbsp; What was
more, he would not do a stroke of work until his claim against
the colliery was settled.&nbsp; <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>He had consulted a solicitor, and a
claim under the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act was pending.</p>
<p>Abner meanwhile waited impatiently for his release.&nbsp; The
presence of his father in the house had eased the awkwardness of
his relation with Alice by abolishing the sense of lonely
isolation that surrounded it.&nbsp; Alice herself was almost
complacent.&nbsp; She did not mind how long John Fellows
abstained from work as long as Abner was left to her.&nbsp; At
the end of May the doctor refused to continue the farce of
signing the miner&rsquo;s certificates.&nbsp; John Fellows
grumbled, but had to admit that he had done fairly well out of
the club.&nbsp; He pushed on his claim for compensation, which
was settled for fifty pounds.&nbsp; Alice was overjoyed at this
windfall, for the strain of her straitened housekeeping had
forced her to run up a few small debts with tradesmen.&nbsp; She
took the opportunity of asking her husband for money when Abner
was in the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Money . . .?&rsquo; said John Fellows.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Money . . .?&nbsp; What do yo&rsquo; want with
money?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s money to do with me when I&rsquo;ve a
son at work earning a man&rsquo;s wages?&nbsp; If yo&rsquo; want
money better ask our Abner.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I keep him all
through his schooling in food and clothes? working day and
night?&nbsp; I reckon it&rsquo;s his turn now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I bain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to keep you in pub-crawling
any longer,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d best give
her some, while you&rsquo;ve got it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going off to
work in Wales.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Work in Wales!&rsquo; cried John Fellows.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you to talk to your father like
that,&rsquo; he cried, coming over to him with his head low
between his shoulders like an angry bull.&nbsp; When he reached
his son he stopped, for Abner had thrown back his elbow.&nbsp;
Alice ran to separate them.&nbsp; There was no need for her to
have done so, for Fellows knew better than to appeal to
force.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a fine pair, the two on you!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And don&rsquo;t you go thinking I can&rsquo;t
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went out of the room with the limp that he now cultivated,
and it was well that he did so, for by this time Abner was white
with rage.&nbsp; He would have followed his father if Alice had
not withheld him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
did he mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>&lsquo;You know what he meant as well as I do,&rsquo;
said Abner with a laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still, that don&rsquo;t
matter.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m off to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he did not go.&nbsp; Thinking the matter over he could not
bring himself to abandon Alice and her child to the desolation
that he knew must follow his departure.&nbsp; It even seemed to
him that his going might suggest to his father that he had hit
the right nail on the head.&nbsp; The fact that, this time, Alice
knew better than beg him to stay, also influenced him.&nbsp; By
this token she accepted his independence and appealed only to his
generosity.&nbsp; She never had a penny of her husband&rsquo;s
fifty pounds.&nbsp; Some of it, no doubt, he owed to the landlord
of the Lyttleton Arms: but in any case it became clear that as
long as it lasted he could not be expected to return to
work.&nbsp; In the meantime he took great pains to avoid crossing
Abner, feeling less obligation towards the housekeeping expenses
from the fact that his nourishment in these days was mainly
liquid and taken elsewhere.</p>
<p>It was difficult to say how long the money would last
him.&nbsp; For the present he was managing extraordinarily well
and there seemed no reason why he should ever take up work again,
although there was now no physical reason why he should not
begin.&nbsp; The summer passed without any change in their
arrangements.&nbsp; Abner still disliked his work.&nbsp; The
prolonged strain of working in cramped positions was beginning to
tell on his eyes; but in the lower levels of the pit he suffered
little from the extremity of heat which made work above ground
almost impossible in the July of that year, and made his father
thirstier than ever.&nbsp; Under the new conditions he found it
impossible to save money for the needs of the day when he should
be free.&nbsp; All his earnings but a few shillings went to Alice
every Saturday night, and it was with difficulty that he
refrained from breaking into the small store that he had kept
intact in his stocking.</p>
<p>On August bank-holiday the men at the pit stopped work.&nbsp;
This was the day of Dulston Wake, the principal festival of the
black-country year.&nbsp; Each of the small towns that lie like
knots on the network of tramways <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>that has its centre in North Bromwich
has its own minor fair of swing-boats, roundabouts, and cocoa-nut
shies, but none of these have half the significance of Dulston
Wake, which is prominent not only by its magnitude but also by
the weight of tradition that belongs to it and by the
magnificence of its setting.&nbsp; In all his life Abner had
never missed it, nor, for that matter, had his father; and when
the day drew near it was taken as a matter of course that the
whole family should put on its Sunday clothes and go to the Wake
together.&nbsp; They left soon after midday, John Fellows already
mildly intoxicated, Abner in his blue suit with a white silk
neckerchief, and Alice, carrying the baby breeched for the
occasion, in her best black costume.</p>
<p>They had to walk more than a mile from Hackett&rsquo;s
Cottages to the terminus of the electric tramway system that had
not yet come to Mawne.&nbsp; John Fellows, who had forgotten his
limp, led the way at a great pace down Mawne bank, so fast indeed
that Alice grew tired by the weight of the child.&nbsp; The day
was one of sweltering heat, of the kind in which the people of
the black-country prefer to take their pleasures.&nbsp; John
Fellows carried a bottle of draught beer in each pocket of his
coat and a red pocket-handkerchief escaped from under the brim of
his bowler hat.&nbsp; He turned to swear at Alice for delaying
the progress of the party, and then, mumbling something under his
breath, put on a spurt of ridiculous energy and left them
behind.</p>
<p>Abner relieved the panting Alice of her burden, and carried
the child on his shoulder.&nbsp; Soon they had crossed the Stour
at the bridge by the gun-barrel works and had gained the relative
coolness of shade under the chestnuts of Mr Willis&rsquo;s
hanging gardens.&nbsp; They arrived at the tramway terminus ten
minutes later than John Fellows to find that he had not profited
by his exertions since the trams were overcrowded and a breakdown
had disorganised the service.&nbsp; He had taken the opportunity
of sitting down on the cinder path and emptying one of his beer
bottles, and as fast as he drank beer sweat oozed from every pore
of his body.&nbsp; When the tram appeared in the distance he
pulled himself up <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>with a grunt and prepared to fight for a seat in
it.&nbsp; It was quite impossible for Alice to compete in this
kind of scrimmage.&nbsp; John Fellows pushed his way in first and
sat fanning himself with his hat while Abner, Alice and the baby
were left behind.&nbsp; They did not see him again during the
day.</p>
<p>They waited for twenty minutes in the sun before they found a
place in one of those reckless tramway-cars that go roaring like
spent shells through all the wastes of the black country.&nbsp;
They could not speak for the jolt and jangle of its progress, for
the clanging of its bell and the alarming sputter of electric
sparks when it swayed on its springs and threatened to jump the
rails.&nbsp; In all their four miles of journey they could see no
green.&nbsp; They passed through endless streets of grimy brick,
baked culverts from which a blast of acrid and lifeless air
rushed through the front of the car like a sirocco.&nbsp; Even
though the fires of the furnaces and factories had been banked
down for the holidays they could still smell the heat which had
scorched and blackened this volcanic country on every side.</p>
<p>At last they were jolted through the narrow streets of
Dulston, happily without catastrophe, and ejected at the foot of
the hill on which its medieval castle stands.&nbsp; Here the
crowd was at its thickest.&nbsp; Noisy hawkers sold ticklers and
leaden water-squirts and programmes of the f&ecirc;te.&nbsp; Tram
after tram disgorged its sweaty contents to mix with the cooler
occupants of brakes and char-a-bancs.&nbsp; Through the dense
foliage of the castle woods that hung limp in the heat like
painted leafage in a theatre, the discordant music of competing
roundabouts floated down, and beneath it one could hear the low,
exciting rumour of the fair, toward which the steady stream of
new arrivals was setting.&nbsp; It was a stiff pull up the slope
of the castle hill and every one who climbed it seemed bitten
with an infectious speed.&nbsp; At the top of it the crowd
thickened beneath the constriction of a narrow Norman arch and
then burst and scattered into the huge central courtyard where
gray ruins looked down upon this modern substitute for the
tourneys of the middle ages.</p>
<p>Abner and Alice were caught up in the excitements of <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>the
fair.&nbsp; He soon added to his burdens by knocking down three
cocoa-nuts.&nbsp; At a shooting-gallery to the admiration of
Alice he smashed thin globes of glass spinning above a jet of
water.&nbsp; For his prize he chose a brooch of imitation gold: a
heart pierced by an arrow and surmounted by the word
&lsquo;Alice.&rsquo;&nbsp; She laughed and pinned it in the neck
of her black bodice.&nbsp; She marvelled at the sureness of his
hand and eye.&nbsp; There was no one in all that crowd whom she
would have chosen for her escort rather than him.&nbsp; She
rejoiced, for the first time in many months, to find him a happy
and natural companion, only wishing that she could forget the
fact that John Fellows also was there, drinking, no doubt, in one
of the canvas marquees that the firm of Astill had erected in
each corner of the courtyard.&nbsp; Once, and only once, she
spoke her thoughts.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder where he is, Abner. . .
.&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; He only laughed at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll find him if you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be soft, Abner,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was only wondering. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>They spent their coppers at a dozen booths, seeing the fattest
lady and the smallest horse in the world, the riders of bucking
bronchos with woolly trousers and slouch hats, who were even
better shots than Abner; and the lady of mystery, who divined the
name and age of Alice and the dates on Abner&rsquo;s football
medals and told them that their married happiness was threatened
by a dark woman.&nbsp; To this seeress Alice protested blushing
Abner was not her husband.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, my love,&rsquo;
said that lady, pointing to the baby, &lsquo;that bain&rsquo;t
nothing to boast about.&rsquo;&nbsp; The crowd in the tent
laughed, and Alice was annoyed with Abner for laughing with
them.&nbsp; &lsquo;You ought to have told &rsquo;er,&rsquo; she
said crossly as they emerged.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s enough to
take my character for life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time the cause of the mystery lady&rsquo;s
speculations was getting tired and peevish.&nbsp; Abner took him
for a ride on one of the galloping roundabout horses, but the
motion only made him sick, and so they left the courtyard and sat
resting in the tepid air under the shadow of the castle beeches,
undisturbed by any <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>but casual lovers who had sought the same kind of
privacy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s awful the way they
be&rsquo;ave!&rsquo; said Alice, hugging the baby to her breast
as though she thought he might be corrupted by the sight of so
much unbridled passion.&nbsp; It came natural to her to adopt
this pose of modesty in Abner&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; She expected
him to agree with her; but he only laughed, and this set her
thinking of the dark episode of Susan Wade and wishing she knew
what actually had happened.&nbsp; &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t ought
to laugh,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it bain&rsquo;t
decent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Abner was too contented to pursue the argument.</p>
<p>The child slept for an hour, and Abner sat smoking beside
them.&nbsp; He went back to the fair-ground and brought her a cup
of tea.&nbsp; Thus refreshed they returned to the castle
courtyard.&nbsp; The sun was setting; the uppermost storeys of
the ruins were tinged with warm and mellow light, but the crowded
space beneath them had grown cooler.&nbsp; Hissing flares of
naphtha were lighted.&nbsp; Swing-boats soared out of the pit of
the ruins into the glowing sky.&nbsp; The crowd, released from
the burden of heat under which it had laboured, began to pluck up
spirits.&nbsp; There was a good deal of friendly horse-play, from
which Alice shrank into the protection of Abner&rsquo;s
bulk.&nbsp; Little John did not seem much the better for his
sleep.&nbsp; He was tired and irritable, and frightened by the
squirts of water and the feathered teasers.&nbsp; It seemed as if
they would have to take him home.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I did want him
to see the fireworks!&rsquo; Alice said regretfully.&nbsp;
Already two monstrous fire-balloons had ascended and drifted away
till they showed no bigger than the moon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on then,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of it if yo&rsquo; have.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s get back before the trams is crowded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took the baby from her arms and she, almost unwillingly,
followed him.</p>
<p>At the end of the courtyard, near the Norman archway by which
they had entered, stood a boxing-booth, inside which the show was
just on the point of beginning.&nbsp; The proprietor, a
heavy-jowled ruffian in a sweater, whose board proclaimed him to
be an ex-welter-weight champion of Bermondsey, had collected a
crowd round <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>his platform by inveighing, in the intervals between
ringing his bell, against the sporting reputation of the
black-country.&nbsp; At the back of the platform two of his
staff, a nigger and a Hebrew, were sparring gently like kittens
at play.&nbsp; It seemed that the reason for his resentment was
his failure to get the Dulston audience to do anything but watch
him and his pets.&nbsp; What he wanted, he said, was sport . . .
just to see what the local talent was made of.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sport?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know the
meaning of the word in this gord-forsaken &rsquo;ole.&nbsp; When
I puts up this tent in Durham or Middlesborough or Wales, they
flock into it, flock in . . . ready to take a turn with the boys
and give a little exhibition.&nbsp; Frightened to use your fists,
that&rsquo;s what you are here.&nbsp; What the hell&rsquo;s
England coming to?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s enough to make me sick, you people!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
enough to make me want to take down the saloon and burn the whole
bleedin&rsquo; bag of tricks, damme if it isn&rsquo;t, an&rsquo;
the boys waiting here for a bit of sport.&rsquo;&nbsp; The nigger
had stopped sparring and was grinning insolently at the crowd,
among the younger women of which his strangeness exercised an
attraction.&nbsp; Nobody, however, seemed inclined to enter the
booth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come along, Abner,&rsquo; Alice whispered, tugging at
his arm.</p>
<p>The proprietor rang his bell again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, for the
last time,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just commencing!&nbsp; If
you haven&rsquo;t the spunk to put on the gloves yourselves, come
and see a pretty exhibition of scientific boxing.&nbsp; And I
give you my word this is the last time I ever bring my
entertainment into the bleedin&rsquo; black-country!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good job, gaffer,&rsquo; said somebody.</p>
<p>The laughter of the crowd made the big man lose his
temper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good job, is it?&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;d ask the gentleman that made that remark to come
up here and say it to my face.&nbsp; Ever hear the name of Budge
Garside?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s mine!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere, I&rsquo;ll
give five pounds&rsquo;&mdash;he pulled out a leather bag of
money and jingled it&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give two pounds to
any of you chaps that&rsquo;ll stand up to me for six
rounds.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I think of the bloody lot of
you.&nbsp; Men!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not one of you <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>black-country
chaps worth the name.&nbsp; All you&rsquo;re fit for, as far as I
can see, is to carry the babby about and &rsquo;old the
missis&rsquo;s &rsquo;and.&nbsp; Yes, sir, it&rsquo;s you
I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Everybody looked at Abner.&nbsp; Alice again tried to pull him
away.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, my dear,&rsquo; said
Garside, encouraged, &lsquo;take &rsquo;im &rsquo;ome before
&rsquo;e gets &rsquo;is pretty face spoiled!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner shook himself free from her hand and shoved the baby
into her arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on, gaffer,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
game.&rsquo;&nbsp; He moved forward through the crowd.&nbsp;
Alice, clinging to him desperately, tried to hold him back, but
the people made way for him, and even helped him forward,
swarming up on to the platform after him.&nbsp; Garside, pleased
with the result of his stratagem, shook hands with him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit I like,&rsquo; he said
thickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come on in and strip.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s
have a drink to start with.&rsquo;&nbsp; They disappeared
together into the tent.&nbsp; Sixpences rattled into the wooden
bowl that the negro held to receive them.&nbsp; Men and women
poured into the booth anxious to see what kind of battering the
representative of the district would get.&nbsp; The little Jew
pushed back the crowd and held up a piece of boarding with the
words &lsquo;House Full&rsquo; painted on it, while the negro
fastened the strings of the tent door.</p>
<p>Alice was left alone in the crowd outside clutching the baby
nervously in her arms.&nbsp; She could not have borne to see
Abner fight.&nbsp; All she could do was to wait patiently outside
and listen in agony for any sounds within.&nbsp; She could hear
very little but the buzz of conversation.&nbsp; Even when she
crept round to the side of the tent and put her ear to the canvas
the sounds that came to her were indistinct, unreal, and blurred
by the nearer rumour of the multitude, the hiss of naphtha
flares, the creaking of swing-boats, cracks of rifles, and above
all the raucous blaring of the steam organs and the shriek of
their whistles.&nbsp; If only she could have heard something she
would have been happier.&nbsp; She could not bear to think of
Abner&rsquo;s white flesh being bruised, and yet, curiously
enough, she was thrilled and proud of him.&nbsp; Her distaste for
violence couldn&rsquo;t get the better of her exultation in her
man&rsquo;s <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>virility.&nbsp; She stood at the side of the tent
tensely listening.&nbsp; A rocket screamed into the sky; there
was a moment of relative silence from the crowd in which she
thought she heard a sound of dull thuds mingled with another
pattering noise.&nbsp; The rocket burst into a shower of gold
amid a salvo of &lsquo;Oh&rsquo;s!&rsquo;&nbsp; The crowd,
noisily streaming towards the ramparts, from which they could see
the fireworks against a blacker sky, jostled her, passing between
the boxing-booth and the next tent.&nbsp; Six rounds!&nbsp; It
could not last much longer.&nbsp; Why had he left her so
roughly?&nbsp; Why hadn&rsquo;t he taken her with him?&nbsp; Of
course you couldn&rsquo;t take a baby into a
boxing-booth&mdash;not even a black-country baby&mdash;but there
was no reason why he should have pushed her aside like
that.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t forgive him that roughness in a
hurry!&nbsp; But she knew that she would: she would forgive Abner
anything as long as he did not disregard her.&nbsp; The crowd
still streamed past her.&nbsp; Showers of starred rockets and
tadpoles of fire were bursting above her in the velvet sky.&nbsp;
A whole battery of maroons shook the ruins.&nbsp; He would be
sorry to have missed the fireworks!&nbsp; If he were badly
knocked about she still had some of Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s ointment
left&mdash;a fine thing for bruises or broken skin.&nbsp; That
was the night, she remembered, when he had come home drunk: the
night when, for a moment they had gazed into each other&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; She knew how dangerous the emotion of pity was.&nbsp;
A set-piece suddenly sputtered out of the darkness.&nbsp; Letters
of fire began to form themselves.&nbsp; What would they
say?&nbsp; <span class="GutSmall">GOD SAVE</span> . . .
&lsquo;The king,&rsquo; of course.&nbsp; Little John began to
cry, saying that he wanted to go to bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, my
precious!&rsquo; she crooned, &lsquo;mammy&rsquo;ll take you
home.&rsquo;&nbsp; Six rounds. . . .&nbsp; She suddenly
remembered how a young pitman at Mawne had once been killed in a
boxing-booth by a knock-out blow on the chin.&nbsp; A knock-out
blow . . . she remembered old Mr Higgins talking of it.&nbsp; But
Abner was strong.&nbsp; Nothing of that kind could possibly
happen to him.&nbsp; Even so, she couldn&rsquo;t get the sinister
picture of Budge Garside with his heavy jowl out of her
head.&nbsp; He was such a deadly-looking customer!&nbsp; Suppose
. . .</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>A sound
of cheering came from inside the tent.&nbsp; She ran round to the
front, wishing to goodness that John would hold his noise.&nbsp;
The curtains opened.&nbsp; The negro came out with another
signboard: &lsquo;Just Commencing.&rsquo;&nbsp; People surged out
of the tent laughing and talking together.&nbsp; A bold girl
burst out laughing in the nigger&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Alice took
hold of the sleeve of one of the men who came out alone and
looked as if he were sober.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell us what&rsquo;s
happened?&rsquo; she gasped; but he only stared at her and shook
his head and went on straight forward as if he had mistaken her
motive for accosting him.&nbsp; The tent emptied.&nbsp; After a
moment she saw Abner shaking hands with the giant in the
door.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t seem to notice her, and when he came
down the wooden steps and she called his name he did not look
pleased to see her.&nbsp; His lip was cut and his forehead still
damp from a vigorous sponging.&nbsp; She took his arm; she wanted
to show him how glad she was.&nbsp; He was too dazed to resent
this familiarity, simply saying: &lsquo;Come on out of
this!&rsquo;&nbsp; In the gate of the courtyard he stopped.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wait a jiff,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better
take the two quid.&rsquo;&nbsp; He gave her the coins and then,
suddenly realising the tiredness of her face in the lamplight,
asked her to give him the kid.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon this is a
man&rsquo;s job,&rsquo; he said with a deep laugh.</p>
<p>This time they caught their tram without difficulty.&nbsp;
They spoke very little, and in whispers, for John had fallen
asleep in his mother&rsquo;s arms, and even if he had wanted to
talk, Abner would have known better than to risk waking
him.&nbsp; As a matter of fact he had taken a good deal of
punishment from Garside&rsquo;s left.&nbsp; On points he would
have been thoroughly outmatched and nothing but his stubborn will
had kept him on his feet until the end of the sixth round.&nbsp;
The mild elation that had sustained him when he left the booth
had now faded, and in its place he began to feel the effects of
the terrific hammering that he had undergone.&nbsp; His lip was
beginning to swell and his body felt cold in spite of the sultry
weather.&nbsp; He dozed in the corner of the tram-car, and when
they came to the terminus and Alice roused him by a touch on his
sleeve, he felt it an unreasonable effort to pull himself
together and carry <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>the child up Mawne bank.&nbsp; The creature was still
asleep and hung a dead weight on his shoulder.&nbsp; Rather than
wake him when they reached Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages Alice carried
him upstairs and laid him still asleep in his cot.</p>
<p>When she came downstairs again she found Abner in the
washhouse bathing his face in cold water.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Abner,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;let me
see to it proper.&rsquo;&nbsp; She took Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s
ointment and some strips of linen from the cupboard, but he
wouldn&rsquo;t let her touch him, saying that he was tired as a
dog and would rather turn in.&nbsp; She gazed at him sorrowfully,
knowing that she could not drive him and fearing to
persuade.&nbsp; He rallied her weakly: &lsquo;If you stand
lookin&rsquo; at me like that yo&rsquo;ll be late for the
funeral,&rsquo; he said, and then, softening, &lsquo;You look
dead tired yourself.&nbsp; Put the light out and leave the door
open.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never done
that.&nbsp; I shall wait up for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you women takes the biscuit!&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>He left her there, and rolling up in his blankets soon fell
asleep.&nbsp; It was not often that he dreamed, but on that night
his dreams would not let him be.&nbsp; From the very moment that
he first slept he seemed to be fighting, fighting with Budge
Garside on a platform of creaking boards with a rope barrier
round it, lit by hissing naphtha flares.&nbsp; Every moment he
grew more exhausted; but he had to go on fighting in spite of the
violent jabs of Garside&rsquo;s fist over his heart.&nbsp; The
crowd in the booth, whose faces could not be seen for tobacco
smoke, were laughing at him, and this filled him with an angry
determination to go through with it.&nbsp; The round seemed
endless.&nbsp; He waited for the umpire&rsquo;s bell to save him,
but the umpire had vanished.&nbsp; And now he was fighting all
three: Garside with his broad, shaggy chest, the small-headed
negro, and the little Jew who skipped about like a flea.&nbsp; He
hadn&rsquo;t bargained to take on all three at once, but there
was nobody to whom he could appeal, and so he had to go on boxing
as well as he could in this hurricane of six fists.&nbsp; He
thought of Alice and the baby whom he had left outside.&nbsp; If
he were knocked out, as he surely must be in a <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>moment, she
would have to look to herself.&nbsp; That couldn&rsquo;t be
helped.&nbsp; Suddenly he heard her calling from outside the
tent: &lsquo;Abner . . . Abner!&rsquo;&nbsp; He tried to call
back to her, just to show her that he was still keeping up, but
no voice would come through his cut lips.&nbsp; Garside landed a
terrific blow on the point of his chin.&nbsp; He woke. . .
.&nbsp; He supposed he was awake.&nbsp; But the voice that he had
heard in his dream still followed him.&nbsp; She was calling
&lsquo;Abner . . Abner!&rsquo;&nbsp; He tumbled out of bed,
pulled on his trousers, and ran downstairs.&nbsp; The mild light
of the kitchen dazzled him.</p>
<p>In the corner, beyond a pile of overturned furniture, he saw
Alice cowering, and above her John Fellows.&nbsp; In the struggle
which he had not heard his father had ripped her bodice and torn
away the gilt brooch that Abner had given her.&nbsp; Now he had
her at his mercy, holding her by the hair, shaking her from time
to time like a terrier with a rat and making her scream with
pain.&nbsp; Abner had never seen such terror in a human
creature&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; When she saw him she cried for his
help.&nbsp; &lsquo;Abner . . . Abner . . . make him give
over.&nbsp; Tell him I done nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner,&rsquo; said John Fellows savagely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Abner . . . there&rsquo;s a bleedin&rsquo; side too much
Abner in this &rsquo;ouse!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get out of it
quick, the pair of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Loose her!&rsquo; Abner shouted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Loose her?&rsquo;&nbsp; John Fellows laughed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ve let her go too much as it is.&nbsp;
Give me the slip, the two of you.&nbsp; Took her off into the
woods, tickin&rsquo; and tannin&rsquo;, you dirty devil!&nbsp;
Give her joolry!&nbsp; Give your own mother joolry!&nbsp;
An&rsquo; what happened when I was on my back in the
hospital?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave go of her!&rsquo; said Abner, coming nearer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the very bed you was born in,&rsquo; cried John
Fellows.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yo&rsquo;re a fine bloody fossack!&nbsp;
Out you go, the both of you!&nbsp; Joolry!&nbsp; Give me the
slip, would you?&nbsp; No &mdash; fear!&nbsp; Gerrup, I
say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pulled Alice up from her knees.&nbsp; Her sobs rose to a
scream.&nbsp; &lsquo;John, you&rsquo;m killing me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner took him by the arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lay hands on your own father, would you?&nbsp; Take
that, you . . . !&rsquo;&nbsp; He hit Abner full on his bruised
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>mouth with
all his strength.&nbsp; Alice, released, ran to the other side of
the room and stood panting, her hands clutching at her torn
bodice.&nbsp; The baby started crying upstairs.</p>
<p>Abner put his hand to his mouth.&nbsp; His lip was bleeding
again.&nbsp; He pulled himself together.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;re boozed,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get on
upstairs!&rsquo;&nbsp; He tried to lead his father to the door,
but John Fellows was not to be put off.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Boozed!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and what would drive a man
to booze worse nor a bad wife?&nbsp; No, yo&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
get out of it like that.&nbsp; What&rsquo;ve you done to
&rsquo;er?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never touched her,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never touch &rsquo;er, an&rsquo; give her
joolry!&rsquo;&nbsp; Fellows scoffed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Maybe
I&rsquo;m boozed, but I&rsquo;m not too boozed to put you to
rights.&rsquo;&nbsp; He launched a savage blow at Abner&rsquo;s
face, and encouraged by the fact that Abner did not return it,
followed it up with another.&nbsp; Alice, crying
&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; ran to the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stay where
yo&rsquo; are!&rsquo; Abner shouted.&nbsp; John Fellows closed
with him, lashing out viciously.&nbsp; He had been something of a
boxer in his day, and his attack was so violent that Abner found
it difficult to defend himself.&nbsp; Fellows fought like a tiger
cat, with boots and finger-nails and teeth.&nbsp; His bloodshot
eyes were fixed on Abner&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; It was as if all
the suppressed malice of seven years had been suddenly
released.&nbsp; Then, suddenly, he dropped Abner and flew at the
frightened Alice.&nbsp; Abner stopped him with a blow under the
right ear.&nbsp; He crumpled up and fell on the floor like a
sack.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner . . . you&rsquo;ve done him in!&rsquo; Alice
cried.</p>
<p>He fell to his knees and listened for his father&rsquo;s
heart.&nbsp; The impulse still fluttered there.&nbsp; &lsquo;No .
. . he&rsquo;s only stunned.&nbsp; I reckon he&rsquo;ll wake up
sober,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; Alice stood trembling and sobbing in
short gasps: a strange, mechanical noise.&nbsp; Abner remained
bent over his father&rsquo;s body in silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Johnnie&rsquo;s crying . . . bless his little
&rsquo;eart!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; He took no notice of
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put the rug over &rsquo;im.&nbsp; Leave him
here till &rsquo;e comes to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, &rsquo;e spoke something awful!&nbsp; &rsquo;E
said you&rsquo;n me had been going together while he was
away.&nbsp; &rsquo;E took up this brooch. . . .&nbsp; A thing
like that!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to &rsquo;ear what he
said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;E said our John wasn&rsquo;t his child . . .
said I&rsquo;d always been rotten bad. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>John Fellows gave a groan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hark, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s coming round,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; I never done nothing! . . .
nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better look to the babby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor lamb!&nbsp; Nothing, I never done, Abner . .
.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you done nothing.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t take no
notice what a man says when &rsquo;e&rsquo;s boozed.&nbsp; You
look to the kid, while I get my clothes on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yo&rsquo; bain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
dress?&rsquo;&nbsp; She picked up the alarm clock that Fellows
had knocked down from the mantelpiece.&nbsp; It was still going,
with a harsh metallic click.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not two
o&rsquo;clock yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he had gone.&nbsp; Left alone she glanced fearfully at the
form of her husband.&nbsp; For a moment he lay quite still.&nbsp;
Then he shuddered, rolled over and began to snore.&nbsp; The baby
was still wailing upstairs.&nbsp; If only John Fellows had been
dead!&nbsp; But that would have been murder.&nbsp; What was Abner
doing?&nbsp; She could not live without Abner.&nbsp; She went
upstairs to his room and tapped at the door.&nbsp; Candlelight
glinted through cracks in the boards.&nbsp; He answered angrily,
she thought, but she came in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing now?&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Putting two-three things together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m off out of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Abner . . . you
can&rsquo;t go and leave me like this.&nbsp; Not with
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t take you along with
me.&nbsp; Not likely!&rsquo;&nbsp; He went on pulling out clothes
from his wooden box.&nbsp; She broke down altogether.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner . . . Abner, don&rsquo;t go and leave me.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t . . . I can&rsquo;t . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; He put on his
scarf.&nbsp; &lsquo;Abner, only stay along with us for a bit. .
.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve stayed too long as it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She tried to put her arms round his neck, but he pushed her
away.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s lucky I&rsquo;ve got a bit of money
put by for a start,&rsquo; he said, fumbling in the mattress for
his stocking.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you what I can
spare.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Then
suddenly he swore violently.&nbsp; He had found the stocking, but
it was empty.&nbsp; He turned furiously on Alice: &lsquo;You
devil, you took it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She fell at his feet, imploring him to believe that she knew
nothing about it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never told you a lie,
Abner,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>His rage made him unreasonable.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re like
the rest on &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Twenty pounds!&nbsp; What have you
done with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I swear I never seen a penny of it, Abner.&nbsp; It
must be there.&nbsp; Look again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had ripped the bed to pieces, but there was no money.&nbsp;
Suddenly light dawned on them both.&nbsp; They had found the
explanation of John Fellows&rsquo; continued affluence.&nbsp;
Thinking of this, they could not doubt where the money had
gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the worst turn he ever done me,&rsquo; he
said, pulling on his cap.</p>
<p>Even now she could not believe that he was going.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not till the morning,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me with him like that in the
dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the kitchen Abner again examined his father, who now
appeared to be sleeping peacefully.&nbsp; &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t
remember a word of it when he wakes,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Again she implored him not to leave her, but now she could see
that entreaties were useless and that his mind was made up.&nbsp;
It was the most awful parting in her life: as final and
annihilating as death.&nbsp; For more than three years she had
lived for him and very little else.&nbsp; He opened the
door.&nbsp; It was a bland summer night, the sky full of soft
stars and the country of a breathing sweetness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So long, then, Alice,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She could not speak.&nbsp; She put up her arms and kissed him
for the first time in her life.&nbsp; He did not then push her
away; but she felt that he was only compelling himself to
tolerate her embrace.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never touched that
money,&rsquo; she said hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you never did,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So long . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>His shadow disappeared into the darkness.&nbsp; She shut the
door of the kitchen.&nbsp; John Fellows lay on the floor snoring,
and upstairs the baby still cried.</p>
<h2><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>The
Eighth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no moon, but the sky,
even at this early hour of the morning, was full of a curious
shimmer of light reflected mirage-like from the upper air
clothing Europe to eastward of the English lands.&nbsp; At that
season of the year sunlight was never distant.&nbsp; Now, every
moment the stars shone fainter, and the slate roofs of the houses
seemed to gather light.&nbsp; Abner stood looking up and down the
Stourton Road.&nbsp; He did not know which way to turn; he was
dazed by the suddenness with which the freedom so long and so
patiently awaited had come to him.&nbsp; In the bewilderment of
the moment he could scarcely even realise that it was
sweet.&nbsp; He had planned it differently and anticipated the
day so often that its violent arrival took him off his
feet.&nbsp; He had expected to leave Mawne deliberately in his
own time and carrying his savings in his pocket.&nbsp; Events had
cast him out violently and penniless . . . not quite penniless,
for he still had a little change left from the money he had taken
to the Wakes.&nbsp; He remembered with regret that he had been
fool enough to give Alice the two sovereigns he had won in the
boxing-booth.&nbsp; They would have come in handy; but reflection
told him that Alice would need them a great deal more than
he.</p>
<p>A man began to cough in the front bedroom of the house before
which he was standing.&nbsp; People upstairs were beginning to
wake.&nbsp; A cock crowed dismally.&nbsp; He had better make up
his mind, for day was beginning.&nbsp; Eastward the Stourton Road
led to Coventry, westward to Wales.&nbsp; Whichever way he went
his lack of money would compel him to walk.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t
afraid of walking or, for that matter, of sleeping rough; and yet
he felt that he was at sea and incapable in his present condition
of making up his mind.&nbsp; His head and body ached with
Garside&rsquo;s blows, for the bruised muscles were beginning to
stiffen.&nbsp; He was sleepy, as well as tired, and
couldn&rsquo;t remember one thing that <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>seemed to be calling for recognition
in the back of his mind.&nbsp; He went on walking aimlessly
towards Halesby; the motion set his mind working once more and he
remembered the thing that had baffled and escaped him.&nbsp;
Tiger. . . .&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t very well leave the dog on
Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; At the same time he didn&rsquo;t
want to frighten the old woman by disturbing her before
daylight.&nbsp; To do so would entail explanations, possibly
arguments on the subject of his filial duties.&nbsp; It would
mean another good-bye, and he wanted to get away quietly without
anything of that kind.&nbsp; Still, he meant to have Tiger as
much for his own comfort as for Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He
determined to see what could be done.</p>
<p>The old woman&rsquo;s house was the last on the right of a
steep, cobble-paved street climbing at right angles to the
Stourton Road.&nbsp; He turned up it, his hob-nails raising
stinging echoes on the stones.&nbsp; He felt as if he must surely
wake every one that slept there.&nbsp; Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s house
was as quiet as the rest.&nbsp; He surveyed it
strategically.&nbsp; At the back of it lay a little yard that in
happier days had been used as a fowl-run.&nbsp; To advertise the
presence of these treasures within, her husband had prevailed
upon the landlord to top the wall with fragments of broken
bottles.&nbsp; This barrier now confronted Abner.&nbsp; Luckily
he was tall enough to reach the top of the wall with his hands,
and he soon discovered that time and weather had taken the nature
out of Mr Moseley&rsquo;s mortar so that it crumbled easily and
allowed him to remove the glass from a foot of the coping.&nbsp;
In two minutes he had done this, straddled the wall, and dropped
down softly on the other side.&nbsp; Tiger, bad watchdog that he
was, still slept.&nbsp; Abner came softly to the door of the
washhouse and tried it.&nbsp; There was no fear that Mrs Moseley
would leave a door unlocked at night even behind a glass-topped
wall.&nbsp; The only other aperture in the scullery was a window
that was too small for him to get through and set very high in
the wall.&nbsp; With his pocket-knife thrust through a broken
pane he lifted the hasp and opened it.&nbsp; Tiger gave a sharp
bark.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&lsquo;Ss . . .&rsquo; Abner whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tiger. . . .&nbsp; Good dog. . .&nbsp; Come on
then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tiger, with a snuffle of recognition, came out of his hole and
yawned.&nbsp; The next moment he was jumping up towards the
window, anxious to get at his master and whining like a baby
because the window was too high for him.&nbsp; Time after time he
leapt and failed to reach the sill.&nbsp; The wall was too
smooth, and the space of the washhouse too cramped to give him a
run for his jump.&nbsp; He grew excited and inclined to be noisy,
and at last Abner, seeing no other way out of the difficulty, put
his arm as far as he could through the window, and when the dog
jumped caught blindly at the loose skin of his back and hauled
him through.&nbsp; Tiger trembled with gratitude and the
anticipation of new joys.&nbsp; He licked Abner&rsquo;s face as
he lifted him up and put him on the top of the coping.&nbsp; He
jumped over into the road and Abner followed him.&nbsp; A
policeman, attracted by the strange phenomenon of Tiger&rsquo;s
egress, watched him as he dropped over.&nbsp; He was a young man,
a football player, who knew Abner, and when he saw Tiger&rsquo;s
master emerge he grinned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Got him out without waking the old woman,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rabbits?&rsquo; said the other, with a wink.&nbsp;
Abner laughed.&nbsp; Both of them knew that the game-laws do not
run in colliery districts.&nbsp; &lsquo;Looks as if &rsquo;e
knows all about it,&rsquo; said the constable at parting.&nbsp;
Tiger was already nearly out of sight, sniffing the grass as he
went.&nbsp; Since Abner went back to work at the pit he had been
deprived of hunting at this ideal hour.</p>
<p>It was extraordinary how Tiger&rsquo;s company restored
Abner&rsquo;s confidence.&nbsp; He felt no longer alone and
worried by indecision.&nbsp; Tiger had gone so far that it was
useless to call him back.&nbsp; He had chosen his own direction,
and Abner was content to follow him.&nbsp; What he wanted most of
all, he decided, was a sleep.</p>
<p>Beyond the level of Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s cottage the houses
thinned away and the ground fell steeply to the fields above the
Stour, the scene of Abner&rsquo;s walks with Susan more than a
year before.&nbsp; Dawn came, heralded by no fierce splendours,
white light stealing from the east <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>over a cloudless sky.&nbsp; The birds
were already awake, but the hush of August held them, so that the
warblers were silent.&nbsp; Larks there were, lost in the sunlit
levels above the whiteness; thrushes made subdued domestic noises
in the hedgerows; linnets already flocking for the early harvest
of seed, rustled the hawthorn thickets, chaffinches sang boldly
in a more vulgar strain.&nbsp; A soft air bloomed the drowsy
hedges.&nbsp; Elder blossoms and slender umbels of parsley flower
gleamed like dull ivory.&nbsp; Light, and more light came welling
over the world.&nbsp; When Abner had reached the plank bridge
over the Stour where Susan first had kissed him, the edge of the
woodland rose up black beyond the stream, the water gleamed
beneath the alders, and the hills, that had lain folded in night,
lifted their heads.&nbsp; Now the birds were silent.&nbsp; Only
the larks still sang.&nbsp; Walking behind the ecstatic Tiger
through a green lane in Uffdown Wood, Abner saw the peak of Pen
Beacon before him smitten with fire.&nbsp; The sun was up.&nbsp;
Gigantic shadows dappled and barred the grass.&nbsp; Tiger,
dancing from side to side, pursued a phantom hound.&nbsp; They
left the woods and dropped over a stile into a winding
road.&nbsp; As yet the sun had no real heat: colour it warmed,
but the air was cool, cool and clean as the surface of this rocky
road so often scoured by torrents.&nbsp; The heavy odours of the
woods belonged to night, but the smell of the road was one of
morning.&nbsp; Gradually the banks released the peculiar perfume
of a hill-country in sunshine, a lovely, healthy savour of thyme
and bracken and dry heather.&nbsp; A breeze swept the
harebells.&nbsp; Still they climbed the path towards the top of
Uffdown where the sun came first.&nbsp; Even at this hour pods
were snapping amid the almond scent of late gorse blossom.&nbsp;
In the shadow of a hedge where prickles were few Abner threw
himself down propping his head on a tussock of thin grass.&nbsp;
He closed his eyes, and was soon asleep, and Tiger, having smelt
and scared innumerable rabbits, came at last to lie beside him,
propping his slender lower jaw upon the smooth of Abner&rsquo;s
thigh.</p>
<p>He did not sleep for long.&nbsp; His watch had stopped, and he
could not tell the time, but from the height of <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the sun he
judged it to be between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The
grass of that southern hedge-side was already warm and fragrant,
and the mistiness of the Severn plain beneath him promised
another day of broiling heat.&nbsp; He was horribly stiff and lay
on with a sense of lazy luxury, letting the sun warm his
bones.&nbsp; Sprawling there with his eyes closed he now began to
consider where he should go.</p>
<p>The obvious goal of an out-of-work in the midlands at that
time was Coventry, an ancient city then rising on the third of
its great industrial booms, the manufacture of motor-cars.&nbsp;
There was always work, and well-paid work, to be had in
Coventry.&nbsp; The journey was short, and Abner had no money to
waste on railway fares.&nbsp; Even so, the idea of merely moving
from one side of the black-country to another did not seem to
represent the kind of radical change that he had intended.&nbsp;
He wanted to make a clean start in a new country.&nbsp; It
suddenly struck him that, after all, there was no real reason why
a man should spend the whole of his life in the dust of coal and
metal or the smell of fire.&nbsp; This joy of sunlight and fresh
air seemed too good to lose.</p>
<p>He knew nothing of the conditions of labour in the country
beyond the fact that many black-country families migrated every
autumn into the fields of Worcestershire for the gathering of
hops.&nbsp; He remembered how he had seen these sun-browned
companies returning, men, women, and children together, carrying
their household goods in old perambulators, looking happier and
more healthy than the majority of Halesby people.&nbsp; He had no
very definite idea when the &lsquo;hopping&rsquo; season began;
but whether he were too late for it or too early he knew, at any
rate, that he had a store of strength and health to sell.&nbsp;
He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of work.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t he work
in the open air?&nbsp; For the summer at least . . . after that
he might go down with the money he had earned into the Welsh
valleys and take to the pit again.&nbsp; He knew that between him
and Wales lay a vast green country in which a man might live as
well as anywhere else.&nbsp; Even now the sun was drinking up the
mists that concealed it, revealing sombre woodlands heavy in <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>leaf, yellow
cornfields, the smoke of hidden towns or villages, and, here and
there, a shining bend of river.&nbsp; From that high post,
indeed, he gazed upon the pastoral heart of England, the most
placid and homely of all her shires; but the national schools had
taught him nothing of these things, and, as the mists ascended,
showing the cliffs of Cotswold long and level, Bredon an island
dome, May Hill and Malvern, Abberley, Clee, and all the nearer
hills of Wales, he only knew that it was green and big and that
it promised freedom.</p>
<p>He decided on Wales, and began to take stock of his
possessions, counting the change that remained in his trouser
pocket&mdash;seven and ninepence ha&rsquo;penny in all&mdash;and
untying the bundle into which he had put a change of socks and
underwear.&nbsp; He wished, now that he came to think of it, that
he had changed into his working clothes, for it did not seem
right to him to look for work in his Sunday best.&nbsp; He turned
out the pockets of the coat, wondering what tokens of his past
life it would disclose.&nbsp; In the breast pocket, to his great
surprise, he found a small packet of paper that he couldn&rsquo;t
account for.&nbsp; He opened it, and found that it contained two
sovereigns.&nbsp; He stared at them incredulously and laughed
aloud.&nbsp; Alice must have slipped them in when she said
good-bye to him.&nbsp; He felt suddenly tender toward her, and
immensely pleased at this striking turn in his fortunes.&nbsp; He
scraped out of his side pocket some dry remnants of tobacco,
filled his pipe, tied up his bundle, whistled to Tiger and set
off down hill leaving the brow of the Uffdown between him and the
blackness of Mawne.</p>
<p>It was all new ground to him.&nbsp; The hills that he was
leaving behind formed a lip of the saucer in which the midland
coal measures lay, and their line had always marked the limit of
Abner&rsquo;s curiosity as boldly as they defined his physical
horizon.&nbsp; Now he was passing quickly to the unknown
plain.&nbsp; The path grew rough and precipitous.&nbsp; For a
hundred yards it cut into a plantation of larches fully
grown.&nbsp; His feet and Tiger&rsquo;s made no sound on the
drift of needles.&nbsp; The wood was dry, warm, fragrant, and as
quiet as a church.&nbsp; One would have thought that no living
creature was there, till Tiger <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>scented a squirrel, and Abner heard
above him the thin alarm note of the wood-wren.&nbsp; From the
wood they crossed a stone stile into a sunless lane, steeper even
than the path across the hill, grass-grown for want of traffic
and now possessed by a company of solemn foxgloves.&nbsp; This
lane, though unfrequented, was the favourite picnic-place of Mr
Willis of Mawne Hall, who always called it &lsquo;our little
Switzerland.&rsquo;&nbsp; The only thing that struck Abner about
it was its steepness.&nbsp; A stone that he dislodged in his
walking bounded on as though it were falling over the roof of a
house, and Tiger scuttled after it full-pelt.&nbsp; Abner also
found that it was easier to run than to walk.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill they came to a deserted watermill,
fed by a stream that here issued from the hills.&nbsp; Near it
stood a large farm-house that had fallen from its state of ease
and comfort, and was now partly inhabited by a labouring
family.&nbsp; A small boy was sitting playing with stones and
eating a crust on the green in front of the house.&nbsp; Tiger
ran up and sniffed at him, and he dropped his crust and ran
screaming up the garden path.&nbsp; A pale woman with red hair
rushed out to see what was the matter and comforted him with her
apron.&nbsp; Abner said good-day to her, but she pulled the child
inside the door as if she were frightened.&nbsp; He heard her
bolting herself in, and laughed, for he didn&rsquo;t realise what
a ruffian he looked with his bruised, unshaven face and his
swollen lip.&nbsp; Tiger, however, had the crust of bread and was
thankful.&nbsp; He was no less hungry than his master.</p>
<p>Down the valley they passed.&nbsp; A hundred yards below the
mill the trees receded and the stream widened into a neglected
fishpond half-covered with water-lily leaves.&nbsp; The air was
full of glittering blue dragon-flies, and the roadside littered
and scorched by the signs of an abandoned gipsy encampment.&nbsp;
The fishpond ended in a patch where the stream gushed through
narrow sluices into a pool of brown, clear water.&nbsp; Sunlight,
beating through the leaves above, lit the bottom with floating
patches of golden brown, showing the shadows of trout that lay
there gently swaying with their heads toward the sweet
water.&nbsp; The coolness of <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>this bathing-place was so alluring
that Abner stripped and washed the slippery sweat from his
body.&nbsp; Tiger, who was used to this kind of performance but
hated water, watched him from the bank.&nbsp; When Abner had
dried himself with his spare shirt they set off again down the
sunny road.</p>
<p>He hoped that they would soon come to a village, for the bathe
had only served to sharpen his appetite.&nbsp; As yet there were
no signs of human habitation, but from the fields that chequered
the hills on either side of the road came many country sounds:
the creaking of invisible cart-wheels, the crack of a whip, the
lowing of cattle and voices of men that echoed in the closed
valley.&nbsp; A little lower down they met a man riding bareback
on a pony, driving a flock of sheep before him.&nbsp; His legs
hung straight down so that they nearly touched the ground.&nbsp;
Tiger and the sheep-dog exchanged inquiries, but the horseman
took no notice of Abner, who stood against the hedge while the
flock stampeded past him with frightened brown eyes, raising a
dust that was laden with a hot smell of wool and sheep-dip.&nbsp;
The farmer&rsquo;s man appeared to be riding in a dream,
mechanically switching the pony&rsquo;s flanks with a branch of
hazel.&nbsp; Abner woke him by saying good-morning.&nbsp; He
stopped the pony with a kick and turned to look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any pub handy hereabout?&rsquo; Abner asked him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pub?&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Ay, you&rsquo;m close on
it.&nbsp; Ten minute&rsquo;ll bring you to the Barley
Mow.&rsquo;&nbsp; Abner had some difficulty in understanding him,
for the language that he spoke was not that of Mawne.&nbsp; He
thanked him.&nbsp; Then, after a long scrutiny, the horseman
informed him that the nearest workhouses were at Bromsgrove and
Kiddy, five miles to the right or left of the inn, said good-bye
and kicked his pony into an amble again.</p>
<p>By that time the sheep had long since pattered out of sight;
but this was an easy country in which hurry had no place.&nbsp;
It amused Abner, and did not in the least offend him, to be taken
for a tramp.&nbsp; In a few days, but for Alice&rsquo;s final
bounty, he might easily have become one.&nbsp; The labourer had
made an estimate of the distance of the pub in accordance with
his own leisurely way of progress.&nbsp; In less than half the
time <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>that
he had predicted Abner found himself in front of an old red-brick
inn shadowed by an immense horse-chestnut whose leaves already
drooped with heat.&nbsp; As Abner reached the door, a man whom he
took to be the landlord was starting to drive off in a yellow
dog-cart, probably to some market, for a small pig was netted in
the back of the trap.&nbsp; A big, blowsy woman whom he called
&lsquo;mother,&rsquo; but who appeared to be of his own age and
was no doubt his wife, saw him off.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
forget Emily&rsquo;s stays, dad,&rsquo; she called.&nbsp; He
waved his whip in answer and went bowling down the road into the
sun.&nbsp; The woman returned with a sigh that sounded as if it
betokened relief, to the wide, semi-circular steps where Abner
was standing waiting for her.&nbsp; She had not seen him arrive,
and appeared not to be pleased at the prospect.&nbsp; When he
began to speak she cut him short with: &lsquo;No, the master
never gives anything.&nbsp; We have to make it a rule on this
road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had to explain that he wasn&rsquo;t begging.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Can you give us a bit of breakfast, missis,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;I can pay for it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He showed her one of
his sovereigns.</p>
<p>She looked him up and down incredulously, and then said:
&lsquo;Come on in and set yourself in the tap.&nbsp; Better leave
the dog outside, or my Betsy&rsquo;ll have his eyes
out.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her Betsy, a big, black tom-cat, too rashly
christened in his first days of innocence, was already arching a
back more like that of a geometer caterpillar than a cat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She can&rsquo;t abear them if she don&rsquo;t know
them,&rsquo; said the landlady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Once she knows them
she&rsquo;ll lie in their arms like a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner left Tiger whining outside the door, and the landlady,
now satisfied that he wasn&rsquo;t as rough as he looked, was
heard shouting orders to Emily in the kitchen.&nbsp; A smell of
frizzling bacon came down the passage.</p>
<p>Abner settled himself on an oak bench.&nbsp; This taproom was
very different from that of the Royal Oak.&nbsp; The floor was of
big, uneven stone flags and all the furniture was black and shiny
with centuries of use.&nbsp; The place did not smell, as did the
Halesby pubs, of stale spirits and tobacco.&nbsp; It was as sweet
as they were sour.&nbsp; Agricultural almanacs and signed
photographs of memorable meets hung on the walls, and <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>over the
mantelpiece a number of cards recorded the fees and procreative
achievements of shire stallions.&nbsp; Abner was nearly asleep
when the landlady herself appeared with a plate of bacon and eggs
and a pot of tea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now, how will that do you?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Abner started to eat and she sat and watched him, apologising
once more for her first reception.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have to be
careful, you see.&nbsp; What with all this unemployment there
seems to be more tramps on the road summer-time than ever there
was.&nbsp; In winter they dies off like the flies.&nbsp; Dad says
they come and go with the swallers.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a lovely
bit of bacon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It became evident from her conversation that she was curious
to know what Abner was doing.&nbsp; She could see that his
clothes were decent and that he wore a silver watch-chain, but
hinted that she couldn&rsquo;t understand the battered state of
his face.&nbsp; He told her that he had had an accident.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;They always go
in threes, and bless me if yours ain&rsquo;t the third I&rsquo;ve
come across this week.&nbsp; Have a drop more
tea?&rsquo;&mdash;she poured it&mdash;&lsquo;Which way are you
going, then?&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d been a bit earlier dad could
have give you a lift.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner told her that he was looking for work, asked her if she
could help him to find it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not a farming man,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;and it&rsquo;s all farmering hereabouts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told her that he was ready to turn his hand to anything,
and she confessed, a little dubiously, that he might possibly get
some casual employment with one of the farmers.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I
was you,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I should go on through
Chaddesbourne and ask at Mr Cookson&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s the
biggest employer round here&mdash;but you&rsquo;re a bit too
early for the harvest.&nbsp; Everything&rsquo;s backward in these
parts after the bad spring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He thanked her, and while she went out to change his
sovereign, put aside a hunk of bread and a slice of bacon that he
had not eaten for Tiger.&nbsp; They parted cheerfully and Abner
set his face towards Chaddesbourne.</p>
<p>The heat of midday now lay heavy on the land, but in this
wooded country-side one might always be certain <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>of
shade.&nbsp; In half an hour he came to Chaddesbourne, a village
of black and white half timber that was already engaged in the
midday coma with which it supplements its normal sleep of
centuries.&nbsp; In all the length of the street Abner saw no
human person stirring, nor any sign of life more violent than
that of lazy butterflies sunning their wings upon the yellow
flowers in cottage gardens.&nbsp; All the half-timbered houses
had long strips in front of them behind which it seemed to be
intended that they should sleep for ever in security.&nbsp; In a
sandstone church some one was playing the organ.&nbsp; Abner had
no ear for music and so he did not stop to listen.</p>
<p>At the end of the village he heard a more welcome sound: the
clinking of a blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer on his anvil and the
hoarse wheezing of bellows.&nbsp; It was very different from
Mawne with its vast hydraulic presses, but it showed the same
process on a small scale, and the smith in his leather apron,
working through the heat of the day, with the sweat tracking
through his coal-dust, was more like a man of Abner&rsquo;s own
race than the labourer in the lane.&nbsp; He seemed glad of an
excuse to stop work and talk to Abner.&nbsp; He offered him a
drink of beer from a bottle, drank himself, and wiped the froth
from his red lips with the back of his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Looking for work!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I
can tell you straight Chaddesbourne&rsquo;s the wrong place for
that.&nbsp; Not even at harvest time.&nbsp; You see, this is a
dairy country, properly speaking.&nbsp; All the milk&rsquo;s
drove to the station and sent into Brum by train.&nbsp; Mr
Cookson?&nbsp; Yes, Mr Cookson&rsquo;s a very nice gentleman as
every one knows; but I reckon he won&rsquo;t be harvesting for
another fortnight, being late-like.&nbsp; Still, there&rsquo;s no
harm in trying.&rsquo;&nbsp; He pulled on his coat and put a
padlock on the door of the forge, for his home was a couple of
hundred yards away in one of the long-gardened cottages.&nbsp; He
said good-bye to Abner cheerily, and gave him directions for
finding Mr Cookson.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I was you,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;I should cut across the fields behind the house.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;ll save you some sweating on a day like this.&nbsp;
Third gate on the right and follow along the hedge on your left
hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Abner
took his advice, and calling Tiger to follow him entered the
field.&nbsp; A quarter of a mile away on the hill-side he could
see the red roof of the building that the smith had pointed out
to him as Cookson&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; Tiger was in his
element.&nbsp; He had never been in a field more rich in rabbit
smell.&nbsp; Abner, following the smith&rsquo;s directions, kept
to the hedge on the left.&nbsp; It ran along the margin of a
little wood that sheltered him from the sun and intrigued Tiger
with prospects of infinite sport.&nbsp; It was impossible to keep
the brute to heel, and though Abner cursed him till he came out
of the wood he could not resist the temptation of running ahead
of his master, sniffing the enchanted air.&nbsp; Suddenly, at the
corner where the spinney ended, he stood stock still.&nbsp; Abner
also stopped and watched him, for he too scented sport.&nbsp;
There was a slight rustle in the hedgerow and a white creature, a
little bigger than a stoat, put out its head.&nbsp; In a second
Tiger had it by the neck and silenced its squealing with a
shake.&nbsp; The next moment the owner of the ferret appeared
round the corner of the hedge, a florid man of forty dressed in a
prosperous greenish cord, carrying a gun.&nbsp; He fired at
Tiger, who stood looking curiously at the ferret as though he
still expected it to get up and run away.&nbsp; Tiger rolled over
without a yelp, and Abner ran straight at the man who had shot
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What you done to my dog?&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what the hell are you doing here, you poaching
blackguard?&rsquo;&nbsp; He saw how ugly Abner looked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Keep clear, or I&rsquo;ll put the other barrel in
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; A stupid-looking labourer slouched round the
hedgeside and picked up the ferret, pinching it as if he were
appraising its value as an article of food.&nbsp; Then, mumbling
something, he thrust it into a sack that he carried and gave the
dead body of Tiger a vicious kick.&nbsp; Abner would have flown
at him for he needed something on which to vent his rage, but Mr
Cookson again threatened to shoot.&nbsp; He had to content
himself with cursing the farmer for his brutality.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The dog didn&rsquo;t mean no harm,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;m a coward to shoot a dog like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so fast, my friend,&rsquo; said the farmer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>finished with you yet.&nbsp; I want
to know what the devil you were doing skulking along my
hedge.&nbsp; Thought you&rsquo;d pick up a rabbit, eh?&nbsp; I
know that game . . . taking the dog a walk.&nbsp; What were you
doing on my land, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; for work,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you look like getting it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
suppose it&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;ll have picked
oakum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner did not hear these words.&nbsp; He thought only of the
shattered heap of flesh that had once been Tiger.&nbsp; He would
have gone blindly for the dog&rsquo;s murderer if he had not
suddenly realised that his own case was hopeless.&nbsp; The owner
of the gun looked like business, and the labourer was now ready
to tackle him from behind.&nbsp; He could do nothing.&nbsp; Mr
Cookson, however, having caught a poacher red-handed,
didn&rsquo;t mean to let him go.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of this game,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You black-country chaps think you can slip
over the hills and do what you like . . . you and your
dogs.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use turning ugly now.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll come along with me to the police station, and
that&rsquo;s all about it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the best ferret
I&rsquo;ve got, worth a dozen of your damned dogs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner, who saw that it was not worth while arguing and whose
anger had now become more subject to his reason, tried to explain
once more that he was coming to the house to ask for work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s an old tale,&rsquo; said Cookson.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve had enough talk.&nbsp; Come along!&nbsp; That
don&rsquo;t explain what you were doing in this field.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The farmer also was now becoming more reasonable.&nbsp; Abner
explained that he had taken the field-path on the smith&rsquo;s
advice.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t credit it, you ask
him,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was the lady at the Barley
Mow sent me here and give me your name.&nbsp; That is if your
name&rsquo;s Cookson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s my name right enough,&rsquo; said the
farmer, &lsquo;and you won&rsquo;t forget it!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
began to grumble at the landlady as the prime cause of his losing
the ferret.&nbsp; None the less, he now appeared to believe
Abner.&nbsp; At the root he was a good-natured man, celebrated
for the sudden violence and quick subsidence of his temper.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&lsquo;Want work, do you?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got no work for you nor no one else, and
if you see Mrs Potter again you can tell her so.&nbsp; What that
woman wants to do using my name I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I
reckon I&rsquo;m feeding half Chaddesbourne as it is.&nbsp;
Still, I&rsquo;m ready to believe you.&nbsp; If you take my
advice you&rsquo;ll clear quick before I change my mind.&nbsp; Go
on, hook it!&rsquo;&nbsp; He put his hand in his pocket and
jingled some money as if he were debating whether he should give
Abner half a crown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about my dog?&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>Mr Cookson took his hand out of his pocket and his neck
flushed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you you&rsquo;d best
clear,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;George&rsquo;ll bury the
dog.&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned to the labourer.&nbsp; &lsquo;George,
you go up to the yard and get a spade.&rsquo;&nbsp; He ejected
the unused cartridge from his gun and turned his back on Abner,
and Abner, still sore with resentment, took his advice and
returned to the road.</p>
<h2><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>The
Ninth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first moment of his loss he
did not feel like retracing his steps.&nbsp; When he reached the
main road he turned his face westward once more and set off
walking as hard as the heat would allow him.&nbsp; He passed
through a land of almost monotonous green, stopping once or twice
to drink a pint of beer at a pub in one of the many half-timbered
villages that straggled along the road.&nbsp; In the afternoon he
reached a crest crowned with a plantation of smooth trunked
beeches from which he could see the chimneys of an industrial
town.&nbsp; This, he decided, must be Kidderminster, or, as the
farmer&rsquo;s man had called it, Kiddy.&nbsp; Once or twice in
his life he had played football there for Mawne United, but in
these excursions he had never noticed anything but the squalid
streets between the station and the football ground.&nbsp; There
was a workhouse in Kidderminster, as he had been told, but he was
not yet in need of workhouses.&nbsp; The landlord of the last inn
had found out that he was going into Wales, and had pointed out
to him the rampart of the Malverns, dim-blue in the heat, as
marking the course of his road.&nbsp; The idea of finding
employment in the country now pleased him little.&nbsp; The
sooner he reached the coal valleys, with the remains of his
money, the better.&nbsp; From his new point of vantage the hills
were still visible, floating like cragged islands in the
haze.&nbsp; He left the smoke of Kidderminster on his right hand
and forsook the road for a narrower lane that seemed to run in
the direction that he wanted to follow.&nbsp; When evening came
he was still walking south-west.&nbsp; Now the Malverns, whenever
he saw them were etched black against a background of
flame.&nbsp; The air was cool and sweeter.&nbsp; It was such an
evening as Tiger would have loved, and his loneliness, which had
been numbed by the heat, returned to him.</p>
<p>He must by this time have walked more than twenty miles since
daybreak, and he was tired and <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>hungry.&nbsp; Soon after sunset he
turned in to an inviting public-house that stood alone on a
straight length of road running between meagre oak-trees.&nbsp;
The landlord was an aged man crippled with rheumatism who sat
grasping two sticks in a chair beside the hearth of the
taproom.&nbsp; He looked suspiciously at Abner and told his
daughter, an angular woman of forty who did all the housework, to
attend to him.&nbsp; This woman gave him clearly to understand
that they didn&rsquo;t like strangers and said that they could
give him nothing to eat but bread and cheese.&nbsp; He accepted
this gratefully and settled down to his supper under the grudging
eyes of the old man.</p>
<p>The inn seemed a lonely and neglected place, for the road on
which it was situate had fallen into disuse.&nbsp; Abner,
however, was glad of a rest, and sat on smoking and drinking beer
for the good of the house when he had finished his supper.&nbsp;
The ale was good and put him in a happier frame of mind, so that
he no longer found the silence of the old man
uncomfortable.&nbsp; A little later a number of farm-labourers
drifted in and ordered their quarts: a solemn and gloomy company
who spoke little and in a language that Abner did not
understand.&nbsp; He tried to put some life into them by standing
treat, but even this order did not arouse the least enthusiasm in
the landlord&rsquo;s daughter, who might reasonably have felt
that things were looking up, or in the company.&nbsp; These
people were silent drinkers who sat in pairs, taking alternate
swigs from the quart pot that stood between them.&nbsp; They
looked upon Abner, this stranger from beyond the hills, as
peaceful border farmers might have regarded a northern
marauder.&nbsp; They drank his beer; but that was all that they
could do for him.&nbsp; The light failed, but no lamp was lit in
the taproom, and one by one the customers bade the landlord
good-night and stole away like shadows.&nbsp; The woman put her
head into the room from time to time as if she hoped to find that
he was gone, and the old man sat by the fireplace saying
nothing.&nbsp; Abner was sleepy and when she next appeared asked
her if she could find him a bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Anything&rsquo;ll
do for me,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can shake down anywhere
you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>For
the first time since Abner had seen her she was really
positive.&nbsp; &lsquo;We never do such a thing, do we,
father?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; The old man did not appear to
have heard her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I bain&rsquo;t one to make trouble,&rsquo; Abner
said.</p>
<p>She wagged her head violently.&nbsp; &lsquo;We never do such a
thing,&rsquo; she repeated.&nbsp; She shook the old man&rsquo;s
shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Father, &rsquo;e says &rsquo;e wants to
sleep &rsquo;ere!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t sleep no strangers,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t sleep no one.&nbsp; Not in a
solitary place like this.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d best be goin&rsquo;,
young man.&nbsp; Time to lock up . . . time to lock
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner asked him where he could go, but neither of them seemed
inclined to help him.&nbsp; They knew of no house that would take
strangers, and the nearest village, Harverton Priors, was more
than three miles away.&nbsp; Even if he went there, they said, it
was unlikely that he would be taken in.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;m
not accustomed to strangers, these parts,&rsquo; the woman kept
on saying.&nbsp; She followed him like an anxious but impotent
dog, edging him away from the counter as if she thought he had
designs on the till.&nbsp; He bought an ounce of tobacco and
departed.&nbsp; When she had got him out of the door he heard a
key turn in the lock and this taciturn person beginning to talk
fast in an excited whisper to the old man in the corner.&nbsp;
Abner laughed.&nbsp; Thanks to the excellence of their beer he
was at peace with the world.</p>
<p>By this time he was getting used to finding himself an object
of suspicion.&nbsp; He determined to give Harverton Priors a
miss, for at this time of night it was probable that the whole
village would be asleep, and to turn in for the night in the
first isolated barn that he found.&nbsp; Failing that there was
no reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t sleep in a dry ditch.&nbsp; His
father had often done so unintentionally and so far seemed none
the worse for it.</p>
<p>A mile or more from that inhospitable inn he saw the kind of
building for which he was looking standing in a field on the left
of the road.&nbsp; It was a red-brick barn, half-timbered like
the houses of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; A group of cows lay
ruminating in their sleep <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>on the far side of it and Abner
picked his way between their shadowy shapes to a doorway with an
oak beam for lintel.&nbsp; A rough door closed the
aperture.&nbsp; At first he thought that it was locked or bolted
but it yielded to his pressure.&nbsp; He half expected to find
some animal inside, for when he first came to the door he had
heard a noise like a calf turning in straw.&nbsp; He struck a
match carefully.&nbsp; The place was clean and dry, half filled
with hay of the last season&rsquo;s harvest that had evidently
been placed there for winter fodder.&nbsp; He decided that the
rustling that he had heard must have been made by rats.&nbsp;
Well, rats wouldn&rsquo;t worry him in his present degree of
tiredness.&nbsp; He closed the door and sank down easily into a
soft, sweet-smelling bed.</p>
<p>He lay still on his back with his eyes wide open staring into
the darkness above him, thinking of the extraordinary variety of
adventures that had filled the last twenty-four hours.&nbsp; This
time last night, he reflected, he must have been dozing in the
corner of the tram-car between Dulston and Mawne.&nbsp; Now he
had nothing left to remind him of his old life except the clothes
he was wearing . . . not even Tiger.&nbsp; He wondered what his
father was feeling like now; wondered what had happened to
Alice.&nbsp; He had never before thought so tenderly of
her.&nbsp; She had shown what she was made of when she slipped
the two sovereigns into his pocket.&nbsp; When he got work in
Wales, he decided, he would send her money . . . not that she
would really need it, for now sheer necessity would compel John
Fellows to go back to the pit, unless indeed he had any of the
money left that he had stolen from Abner.&nbsp; The thought of
his savings suddenly reminded him what a fool he had been not to
search his father&rsquo;s pockets before he left the house.&nbsp;
On the whole he wasn&rsquo;t sorry that he had left him
undisturbed.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t feel unkindly toward him, for
he recognised that no man is responsible for what he says or does
when he is drunk.&nbsp; In the black-country people who know the
rougher side of life are always ready to condone crimes of
passion or liquor.&nbsp; &lsquo;The old chap&rsquo;s welcome to
the money,&rsquo; Abner thought, &lsquo;leastwise if any of it
comes our Alice&rsquo;s way.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>His
mind was still too crowded for sleep.&nbsp; He thought he would
have a smoke and began to fill his pipe with the tobacco he had
bought earlier in the evening.&nbsp; Again he heard a rustling
noise in the hay.&nbsp; When he lit his pipe he would try to see
what caused it.&nbsp; He waited, listening, and when next he
heard it struck a match and peered in the direction from which it
came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Douse that light, mate,&rsquo; said a voice, almost at
his elbow, &lsquo;and take your bloody feet off my chest.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be afther settin&rsquo; the place alight and sending
the both of us to hell before our time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner dropped his match with astonishment.&nbsp; The other,
suddenly materialising, put his foot on the glowing fragment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I reckon you give me a bit of a start,&rsquo; said
Abner, laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Start, is it?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s finished we&rsquo;ll be
if you go throwing match-sticks that way into a heap of
tinder.&rsquo;&nbsp; The turn of speech amused Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s easy to see that you don&rsquo;t know the
way to travel, or you wouldn&rsquo;t be doing the like of
that,&rsquo; said his unseen companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;I may well
be stranded to the world, but it&rsquo;s not burning I want this
night of our lord, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He settled down into the hay again, this time at some distance
from Abner.&nbsp; Abner had never yet caught a glimpse of
him.&nbsp; He could not tell whether he was old or young,
pleasant-looking or villainous, but he knew that the stranger was
the first person who had accepted him without question since his
wanderings began.&nbsp; He no longer felt sleepy and was indeed
glad of a chance to talk with another human being.&nbsp; In this
at any rate his shadowy companion was ready to oblige him, taking
the conversation into his own hands without the least
hesitation.&nbsp; He asked Abner where he had come from and how
long he had been on the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God help me!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not
born yet!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he asked Abner if he could spare him
a gorm.&nbsp; Abner had not the least idea what a gorm was, but
the voice explained that it meant a little weeny dooney bit of
tobacco&mdash;&lsquo;for to chew,&rsquo; he explained, &lsquo;we
don&rsquo;t <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>want anny more fireworks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anny more for
Annimore,&rdquo; as the guard says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner gave him his gorm, deciding that the owner of the voice,
whatever he looked like, was a cough-drop.&nbsp; They drifted
into a discussion of Abner&rsquo;s adventures during the day.</p>
<p>The owner of the voice, who in the course of conversation
proclaimed himself to be a certain Mick Connor, usually known as
Kerry Mick, had apparently followed much the same track as
Abner.&nbsp; He had been refused refreshment at the Barley Mow
and taken a dismal pint from the hands of the landlord&rsquo;s
daughter at the second inn, whose nose, he said, would poke a
ragman over a double ditch.&nbsp; He listened more seriously to
Abner&rsquo;s account of Tiger&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;re after losin&rsquo; a good friend,&rsquo; he
said, and after a moment of silence in which his jaws could be
heard masticating his gorm, embarked on a long story of his own
youth.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something quare,&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>It had happened more than twenty years ago in the county of
Kerry&mdash;Abner was none the wiser&mdash;in the very first
situation that Mick Connor had ever taken.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was
money in Ireland them days,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
country&rsquo;s gone to the dogs ever sence the Boer
War.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was engaged as pantry-boy, at six pounds a
year and a suit of clothes, and he earned it by cleaning thirty
lamps and a dozen pair of shoes every morning before breakfast
and waiting at meal-times in the servants&rsquo; hall.&nbsp; The
rest of the day he spent in dodging the butler, an ould devil
with a lip would trip a duck, who liked his pint more than most
and used to threaten to take the skin off of him with a twig
whenever he saw him.</p>
<p>The story seemed to lead nowhere, but Mick Connor&rsquo;s
voice was low and persuasive and he evidently liked
talking.&nbsp; Abner lay and listened.</p>
<p>Even in those early days Mick Connor had been used to the open
air.&nbsp; He hated house-work, he said, and would often go off
and hide himself under the dining-room table, a place of
concealment which the butler at last discovered, to cry.&nbsp; He
would stand at the pantry windows looking out over the fields to
the <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>river where the third footman was already enjoying
himself catching eels and perch in the holes.&nbsp; The house was
a prison to him.&nbsp; The only friend that ever came to him from
outside it was a wolfhound who slept in the stables, but with
whom he had made great friends ever since he had been in the
house by feeding it with scraps from the pantry.&nbsp; The butler
hated dogs, and this dog above all others because it had once
stolen a ham.&nbsp; Mick loved it and fed it regularly.&nbsp; It
used to jump up to the pantry window and lick his face through
the bars.</p>
<p>When he had been in this place for a year or more the family
moved for the summer to another house on the coast some thirty
miles away.&nbsp; For Mick it was a happy change.&nbsp; He and
his friend the third footman were chosen to go there and the
savage butler was left behind.&nbsp; There were no railways in
that part of Ireland, and so they went to Coulagh by road.&nbsp;
The children were to follow with their nurse the next day, so the
footman and the cook preceded them in a wagonette loaded with
luggage.&nbsp; They went slowly, and behind them walked Mick,
leading two pannier asses named Haidee and Mokie, on which the
children would go for rides by the shore.&nbsp; They started late
and the last part of their journey was made in the dark.&nbsp;
The cook, who had a drop taken, was telling ghost stories fitting
to that wild hour and place.&nbsp; There was one tale in
particular of how she had met the devil in the flesh sitting by a
milestone near Coulagh three years before that made Mick afraid
to look on either side of him.&nbsp; He walked with Haidee on his
right and Mokie on his left and the tail of the wagonette in
front of him, and even then he didn&rsquo;t feel safe.</p>
<p>When they came to Coulagh in the darkness they had a grand
supper, but even in the cheerful firelight Mick couldn&rsquo;t
forget the details of the cook&rsquo;s encounter with the
devil.&nbsp; The house was small, and it had been settled that
he, as the least important member of the party, should sleep in a
little room above the stable in which the asses were
housed.&nbsp; He was thankful that the animals were there, for
otherwise he would have gone mad with the loneliness.&nbsp; When
he reached the stable <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>he went into the stall and talked to
them and got on the two of their backs, sitting first on one and
then on the other the way they wouldn&rsquo;t be jealous.&nbsp;
Then he patted their necks, rubbed their noses, and went up the
wooden stairs to bed.&nbsp; He undressed, got into bed and put
out his candle.&nbsp; But he couldn&rsquo;t sleep, partly because
the room was so strange after the cook&rsquo;s stories and partly
because a wind was blowing fit to bring the house down.&nbsp; All
of a sudden the wind fell, and in the quiet he could hear another
sound like a door banging and the rattle of chains.&nbsp; He
supposed he had not fastened the stable latch, but even if the
asses got their ends of cold, he didn&rsquo;t dare to put his
nose out of bed.&nbsp; But the noise of bumping and chains
continued.&nbsp; Even when he put his head under the clothes he
could still hear it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can hear it the way I am
now,&rsquo; he told Abner, &lsquo;a great, rattlin&rsquo;,
t&rsquo;udding noise.&nbsp; I commenced to get terrible
afraid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s surely coming now,&rdquo;
I thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;God help me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And it came on
bumping and rattling up the stairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the
devil,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;let loose on me!&rdquo; an&rsquo;
when I put my head under the clothes what should I see but all
the things I&rsquo;d ever done in this life; all the birds
I&rsquo;d took the heads of off with a catapult, flittin&rsquo;
about with no heads and the wings broke on them, and all the
bottles of whisky I&rsquo;d ever stolen on the butler.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; the noise come bumping upstairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;God,
I&rsquo;m gone!&rdquo; I says, getting down middleways in the
bed, and with the same there was a great t&rsquo;ud and the door
flew open on me and it come into the room.&nbsp; Bump, bump, bump
it went, an&rsquo; the chairs went over and the basin of water
I&rsquo;d never washed in come down with a crash&mdash;and I
lying there with the pespiration running down me on to the sheets
like a spout.&nbsp; &ldquo;God, I&rsquo;m gone!&rdquo; I says
again, and that was the last word I spoke that night, for the
sheets was stuck to me back.&nbsp; Then it comes over to the bed,
and I tries to get under the mattress, but before I knew where I
was I felt two great hands on the both of my thighs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m destroyed altogether,&rdquo; says I, but
before I&rsquo;d finished thinking it come on the top of me in a
lump with the chain draggin&rsquo; along the floor, and me
lyin&rsquo; there not as thick as a match.&nbsp; Then I <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>commenced
to feel the sheet being drew down over my face and two hairy arms
round my neck, and with that a great, big, hot tongue licking
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, my beautiful,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I have
you at last.&rdquo;&nbsp; That dog was so fond on me he&rsquo;d
smelt me out over thirty miles and pulled the log he was tied to
in the stable after him and broke down the door and come upstairs
into bed with me.&nbsp; I loved that dog.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s
why I say you&rsquo;re after losin&rsquo; a good friend in
yours.&nbsp; Give me the lend of another gorm to go to sleep
on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner gave him the tobacco, and after that the story-teller
was silent.&nbsp; Falling asleep, Abner heard only the regular
noise of his companion&rsquo;s jaws as they chewed.&nbsp; In half
an hour they were both asleep.</p>
<p>Early next morning Mick Connor woke him, telling him that
unless they cleared out the farmer&rsquo;s men would find
them.&nbsp; Abner was far too comfortable for the moment to want
to move, but as soon as he regained full consciousness he
realised that his skin was itching all over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This place is alive with fleas,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>His companion only laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all you
know about it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and the both of us eat with
hayseeds.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m after telling you
somethin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Never choose hay to sleep in if you can
fin&rsquo; straw.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worse than a houseful of
bugs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner was curious to see the owner of last night&rsquo;s voice
and the teller of stories.&nbsp; He found it difficult to fit in
the man with his narration.&nbsp; It was impossible to guess his
age, but his hair was slightly touched with gray and stood up in
a frizzy mass that made him look wilder than he was.&nbsp; He was
of middle height, thin and very wiry, with a small head, bright
eyes like a bird and a bony face in which the skin over the
cheekbones was netted with red veins.&nbsp; His eyes were blue,
and humorous or savage as the occasion took him.&nbsp; At this
hour of the morning he did not appear anxious to talk and his
voice that had been soft and persuasive in the darkness, was
rough and short.&nbsp; They left the barn together.&nbsp; The
cows were still sleeping outside and a dew was on the grass, but
the moisture had not fallen on the road, which seemed as baked
and dusty as ever.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&lsquo;Which ways are you going?&rsquo; the Irishman
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going to Wales,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the two of us had better travel together,&rsquo;
he said, and Abner consented.</p>
<p>They walked for some miles in silence.&nbsp; Mick, at this
hour of the morning was not disposed to talk.&nbsp; He went on
ahead with a long, loping gait, very different from the
tramp&rsquo;s habitual shuffle.&nbsp; They came to a brick bridge
that proclaimed itself unsuitable for traction engines, and here
he suddenly climbed the hedge and started to wash himself in a
bed of cresses.&nbsp; He took out the broken end of a comb and
smoothed his wet hair close to his head like a picture of the
Madonna.&nbsp; The water took the gray out of it so that he
looked almost young.&nbsp; Abner also washed, and when he had
picked the irritating hayseeds out of his shirt, he offered his
companion half of a piece of bread that remained in his
pocket.&nbsp; Mick took it without a word and dipped it in the
water.&nbsp; Without this soaking he could not have tackled it,
for though his bristling moustache concealed the fact, he had
scarcely any teeth.</p>
<p>Eating this breakfast together they sprawled on the bank of
the stream among rushes, with which Abner amused himself by
stripping the pith with his nails.&nbsp; His silent and
melancholy companion broke the silence by asking him if he had
any money.&nbsp; Immediately Abner was suspicious.&nbsp; His
second sovereign and all his silver were secreted in his
waistcoat pocket.&nbsp; He had placed them there in the night as
soon as he realised that he was not sleeping alone.&nbsp; In
answer to his friend&rsquo;s question he produced a handful of
coppers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tenpence ha&rsquo;penny,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;That won&rsquo;t go far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Houly sufferings!&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;is it
carry ten-pence halfpenny three miles?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke no more, and they set off again.&nbsp; During the
rest of the day Mick Connor maintained his attitude of
detachment, striding on ahead of Abner as though he had nothing
to do with him.&nbsp; They bought a stale loaf in a small market
town and the Irishman produced from the treacle tin that he
carried three eggs and some rashers of bacon.&nbsp; They lit a
fire on the edge of <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>a wood and made a good meal.&nbsp;
Toward evening they crossed a wide river flowing silently between
high banks.&nbsp; Mick, who appeared to know the country, told
Abner that this was the last bridge for twenty miles.&nbsp;
Beyond the stream a little town lay smoking under the
hill-side.&nbsp; They drank a pint of beer together and pushed
on.&nbsp; The evening light seemed to awaken Mick.&nbsp; He
became talkative and profane at once, disclosing to Abner the
fact that he knew where good work was to be had.&nbsp; He scoffed
at the idea of Abner&rsquo;s working underground while there was
a chance of earning his living in the open air.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
can put you in the way of a job will make your teeth
water,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; At first he kept up an atmosphere of
mystery of the kind that particularly pleased him, but when Abner
pressed him he disclosed the fact that he had learned from a
tramp near Bromsgrove how the corporation of North Bromwich were
engaged in relaying a defective piece of piping ten miles long in
their Welsh water scheme, and that casual labour was hard to get
in those parts.&nbsp; With the combination of his own wit and
Abner&rsquo;s strength they should find a comfortable job to last
them for six months.&nbsp; He reckoned that three days&rsquo;
walking would bring them easily to the site of the work, and gave
Abner to understand that he was lucky to have met him.&nbsp;
Abner was ready to acknowledge this.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
all right then,&rsquo; said Mick, &lsquo;and now about that
tenpence halfpenny.&nbsp; Do you think I&rsquo;d be after
sleeping wud you and not know of the gold sovereign that&rsquo;s
in your waistcoat pocket this moment?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s on the
table the cards should be if we&rsquo;re travelling
together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this Abner was really angry.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t like the
idea of any one, friend or no, rummaging in his pockets at
night.&nbsp; They stopped in the road quarrelling, and Abner took
off his coat, preparing to settle the matter with blows before
parting company.&nbsp; The Irishman seemed surprised that he took
it so roughly; pointed out that when he had the chance of
stealing Abner&rsquo;s money he hadn&rsquo;t taken it, said that
he didn&rsquo;t want a penny of it.&nbsp; Little by little, with
soft and humorous words he cooled Abner&rsquo;s anger.&nbsp; At
the next inn they <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>split the sovereign over two quarts of beer, and by the
time he had finished drinking Abner was ready to go shares with
the change, an offer that Mick was too generous to accept.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What for would I want money?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;as
long as I&rsquo;d have the price of a naggin in my
pockut?&rsquo;&nbsp; A man must be a fool, he added, if he
couldn&rsquo;t travel in a fat country the likes of England
without money.&nbsp; In Ireland, it was true, one had to use
one&rsquo;s wits, for every one else was doing the same
thing.&nbsp; He searched in his pockets and laid out a yellow
piece of paper among the beer-spills on the inn table.&nbsp; An
Irishman&rsquo;s passport, he called it.&nbsp; Actually it was an
eviction order, which seemed to Abner an unusual type of letter
of credit.&nbsp; Not a bit of it, said Mick.&nbsp; In Ireland all
you had to do was to carry this along with you and tell a tale
about the little children was starving on you, and you could kick
a shillun out of every priest you come across.&nbsp; In the old
days there was many a toff that&rsquo;d give you half a crown to
be rid of you.&nbsp; They had another drink, and Mick became
rhapsodical on the subject of money.&nbsp; What good had money
ever done him?&nbsp; Money . . . in his day he&rsquo;d had the
money would buy the two sides of Grafton Street.&nbsp; He
recalled his great double on Winkfield&rsquo;s Pride and
Manifesto for the Lincoln and National.&nbsp; Three hundred
pounds in his pocket . . . but it went away like wather.&nbsp;
Porther would have supplied a better simile.&nbsp; When once he
began to talk about horses there was no stopping him.&nbsp; The
lust of the born gambler shone in his small blue eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take away racing and I&rsquo;m gone,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing that keeps the life in
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; He went on talking until he saw that Abner was
nearly asleep over the table, then he plucked at his arm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come along,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s be getting
a move on before we&rsquo;re threw out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That night, in a condition of sublime charity toward the world
and each other, they could find no barn to sleep in and rolled
themselves up on a bank of dry bracken under the misty
moon.&nbsp; Counting his money next morning Abner found that most
of it had gone.&nbsp; He knew better than to grumble about it,
but suggested to Mick that they had better go easy.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>&lsquo;Go aisy, is it?&nbsp; Not at all!&rsquo; said
the Irishman.</p>
<p>At midday, leaving Abner in a small spinney of firs, he went
off to the nearest village with the price of a quart, and
returned a couple of hours later laden not only with the beer but
with a good-sized fowl and pockets full of potatoes.&nbsp;
Displaying these spoils he winked, and Abner asked no
questions.&nbsp; They boiled water in Mick&rsquo;s treacle tin,
and having poured this over the bird to make the plucking easy,
roasted it with the potatoes in the embers of their fire.&nbsp;
It was a splendid meal.&nbsp; Beneath its charred covering the
flesh was sweet and juicy.&nbsp; Abner had never felt fitter in
his life or freer from every vestige of care.&nbsp; When the meal
was over Mick slept like a gorged boa-constrictor and woke in an
ill-temper, but by this time Abner was getting used to his
alternations of enthusiasm and melancholy and left him
alone.&nbsp; It was a good life: there was no denying that, and
in another day or so they would arrive at the scene of their new
work.</p>
<p>That misty moon was no negligible portent, for at sunset great
clouds began to gather from the south, and, before night, fell a
thunder shower that drenched them.&nbsp; The dusty road drank up
the rain and all the earth smelt sweet, but the August weather
had broken and the country of wooded hills into which they had
now come seemed to breed rain.&nbsp; They decided that it would
be impossible to dry their clothes, and pushed on through the
night, Mick loping ahead like some drowned bird and Abner
stolidly following.&nbsp; They passed through the wet streets of
a country town at midnight.&nbsp; Not a light could be seen in
the solemn Georgian houses, but from a belfry, almost lost in
cloud, the sound of a plaintive carillon floated down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ludlow,&rsquo; said Mick.&nbsp; &lsquo;There do be
races here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They crossed another noisy river.&nbsp; The road climbed
endlessly, winding over a steep hill-side.&nbsp; They entered a
forest where the rain troubled them no more, so tired that they
decided to rest for a while.&nbsp; Here they had the luck to find
a hut thatched with heather that had been used by
woodcutters.&nbsp; At the risk of burning it over their heads
they lit a fire with some dry branches that they found inside
it.&nbsp; Here they lay half-blinded <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>with wood-smoke stolidly chewing
tobacco, for Abner, unused to the road, had allowed his store to
become soaked.&nbsp; Mick soon fell asleep, but Abner could not
do so.&nbsp; He lay there till dawn in his steaming clothes,
listening to the incessant dripping of the rain from millions of
leaves, a sound that was soothing in spite of its
desolation.&nbsp; Sometimes a wind that could not be felt would
stir the tops of the trees to a commotion and then the drops
would fall like hail on the soaked leaves of the forest.&nbsp;
The fire died down; there was no more wood in the hut, and drops
of water began to fall from the roof into the hissing
embers.&nbsp; It was hellishly cold, but Mick still slept like a
dog, though his left leg twitched in his sleep.&nbsp; At dawn
Abner woke him.&nbsp; He grumbled because Abner in his vigil had
finished the tobacco.&nbsp; It looked once more as if they were
going to fall out, but the sense of common misery was too great
to allow them to do so.</p>
<p>They tramped on through the woods in the rain.&nbsp; They
could see nothing ahead of them but misty trees and no sound came
to them but that of dripping moisture and sometimes the harsh
call of a jay.&nbsp; The sun was so completely veiled that dawn
passed into day almost without their knowing it.&nbsp; Only a
whiter, colder light gleamed from the wet leaves.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll never get shut on these bleedin&rsquo;
trees,&rsquo; said Abner; but his companion did not answer.&nbsp;
Suddenly Mick began to sing in a hoarse, unnatural
voice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Macarthy took the floor in Enniscorthy;<br />
Macarthy took the floor in Enniscorthy;<br />
For his eyes and ears and nose<br />
Were like marbles on the floor<br />
Of the fragments of the man they called Macarthy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sang the same verse over and over again, and at the end of
the third repetition, he stood stock still, for they had come to
the edge of the wood.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the houly, we&rsquo;re
through wud it!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>The huge confusion of the Radnor march lay before them, vast
and sombre and wild with cloud.&nbsp; To north and south of the
spot where they were standing the woods rolled backward into
England, upward to the <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>sky.&nbsp; It was difficult to
believe that they had emerged a little below the crest of the
hills, for the precipitous wall behind them rose magnificently
black into the mist with fleeces of cloud entangled in its
surface like wisps of wool in a winter hedge.&nbsp; Beneath their
feet a lake of white vapour hid the trough of the Teme valley
lapping the bases of other wooded hills.&nbsp; Nothing could they
see but dark masses of trees thrown into fantastic folds and
pinnacles by the shapes of the hills that carried them: an
amphitheatre of savage stone fleeced with unending woods.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Wales,&rsquo; said Mick.&nbsp;
&lsquo;God!&nbsp; I could do with a drop!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the melancholy grandeur of the scene Abner felt
that an end was in sight.&nbsp; They scrambled down a steep bank,
and Mick, still singing, stampeded a flock of horned black-faced
sheep that crowded with glistening wool under the lee of a
hedge.&nbsp; They crossed a zone of huge, wind-writhen hawthorns
and came to a road, or rather a rutted track of wheels that cut
the hill-side diagonally.&nbsp; In the middle of this track stood
a wooden sled with iron chains for carting timber and a pile of
tree-trunks that had been dumped at this stage of their descent
from the woods.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Plenty of work here,&rsquo; said Mick, &lsquo;time
they&rsquo;ve finished clearing these.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They followed the track to a gate that gave on to a metalled
road.&nbsp; Even this was heavily scarred with the cartage of
timber.&nbsp; On every side the vast debris of forestry was
seen.&nbsp; Birds began to sing in the wet hedgerows.&nbsp; The
road was alive with yellow-hammers and linnets.&nbsp; The rain
ceased.</p>
<p>The scramble down the hill-side had warmed them and they now
walked at a good pace.&nbsp; Villages were few, the greatest of
them no more than hamlets clustered about red-brick farms, and as
yet no labourers were seen in the fields.&nbsp; For miles and
miles they passed no public-house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ne&rsquo;er a drop stirrin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said
Mick.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a grand country, right
enough!&rsquo;</p>
<p>By eight o&rsquo;clock the sun was through and the folding
mist, sucked upwards, revealed great stretches of arable land
that would have been melancholy in dull <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>weather but
now began to gleam in patches of warm colour.&nbsp; Moisture
clarified all the air; oat-fields ripening for harvest were full
of tawny lights, and the breasts of the linnets rosy.&nbsp; A
signpost told them that they were less than a mile from Aston by
Lesswardine, and in a few moments they saw a little church hedged
in with pagan yews and a dilapidated parsonage still dead
asleep.&nbsp; Mick thanked God for the sight of an inn, even
though it were closed.&nbsp; A swinging sign with a heraldic
device battered by long conflict with rain and wind proclaimed it
the Delahay Arms.&nbsp; Tall hollyhocks stood sentinel on either
side of the door.</p>
<p>At the end of the village they took a cross-road to
Lesswardine, moving through water-meadows of brilliant emerald
with placid dykes on either side.&nbsp; Somewhere near them ran a
river, its course marked by a black line of brushwood.&nbsp;
Sunlight becoming more generous warmed them through and
through.&nbsp; The road drew near to the river and to a spur of
hills nursing the valley of a tributary.&nbsp; In a sheltered
coomb they saw an encampment of white tents bleaching in the
sun.&nbsp; A wood fire was lighted among them.&nbsp; The smoke
went straight upward.&nbsp; Round the fire they saw men lounging
in their shirt-sleeves among great stacks of alder-wood.&nbsp;
There was a tempting smell of bacon in the air which made their
mouths water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are these chaps about, Mick?&rsquo; Abner
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cloggers,&rsquo; Mick shouted back to him.</p>
<h2><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>The
Tenth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> and Mick advanced to the edge
of the bivouac.&nbsp; Its inhabitants did not seem to be
disturbed by their presence.&nbsp; Mick, who was never at a loss
for words, gave them good-morning.&nbsp; A tall man, with a
large, unshaven face and a check handkerchief knotted round his
neck, who was sitting on a log by the fire, turned and stared at
him.&nbsp; He had wide, humorous eyes and when he spoke he gave
the impression, by winking, that his words concealed some subtle
joke.&nbsp; Meanwhile with each of his hands he sat fondling an
immense and hairy forearm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, lad, what is it?&rsquo; he asked, in a strong
Lancashire accent.</p>
<p>Mick explained that Abner and he were looking for work on the
Welsh water and asked if it were anywhere near by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh, you&rsquo;ve a good step yet,&rsquo; said the
other.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;re working up beyond Chapel Green,
two miles from Lesswardine.&nbsp; Been long on the
road?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Four days,&rsquo; said Mick.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hear there
do be a good job goin&rsquo; there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said the north-countryman
sardonically.&nbsp; &lsquo;Work for them that likes
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; His wink seemed to imply that Mick obviously
didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Three other men lounged up to them.&nbsp; Another, who was
holding a shovel over the fire, sang out: &lsquo;Come on, Joe,
the rasher&rsquo;s done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The big man raised himself from his log.&nbsp; Before this it
had been impossible to realise his hugeness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Better
have summat t&rsquo;eat wi&rsquo; uz,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>His sudden hospitality, so little in keeping with his
appearance, surprised Abner.&nbsp; In a few minutes they had
settled down with the rest to the enjoyment of the frizzled bacon
and large cans of tea.&nbsp; Mick was soon at home, contriving at
the same time to eat enormously and to keep the conversation
going.</p>
<p>The encampment, as he had first explained to Abner, <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>was one of
many such that may be found scattered up and down the length of
the Radnor march in summertime.&nbsp; The men who inhabit them
are known as cloggers.&nbsp; They come from the black industrial
towns of Lancashire, and their business is the making of wooden
clogs.&nbsp; All are skilled labourers, and in each of their
communities there is a foreman on whom the commercial
responsibilities of the venture falls.&nbsp; Early in spring he
makes a visit to the border country and bargains with farmers and
landowners for the right to cut the thickets of black alder that
choke the bottom of every valley in this western brookland.&nbsp;
In May the rest of the gang follow and there begins a nomadic
life in which they wander from valley to valley, felling the
thickets, stripping the black bark from wood of a milky whiteness
and cutting billets of a size suitable for clog-making.&nbsp; On
rainy days when their harvest is well in hand, they carry the
process further, and set to making the clogs themselves.&nbsp;
Sometimes they live under canvas on the site of their labours;
sometimes they find lodgings in the nearest village; always, as
strangers&mdash;or rather as migrants&mdash;they carry with them
a reputation for boldness and extravagance in speech and
behaviour; but, for all that, the border people make much of
them, knowing that they earn plenty of money and spend it
freely.</p>
<p>The valley on which Abner and his friend had lighted was by
this time nearly stripped of its alders.&nbsp; Piles of clean
white billets stood bleaching in the morning sun ready to be
carted to the nearest point on the railway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not afther wanting a hand with the
wood?&rsquo; Mick asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, lad,&rsquo; said the big man, &lsquo;this is a
tradesman&rsquo;s job.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get work right enough
up by Chapel Green.&nbsp; You tell the foreman that Wigan Joe
sent you along.&nbsp; But happen you&rsquo;ll find it hard to get
a lodge there.&nbsp; Come Tuesday we&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; a
shift to Mainstone Bottom, and me and my mates are going to take
a lodging in the Buffalo.&nbsp; Old Mr Malpas or his son
George&rsquo;ll see you right.&nbsp; Happen we&rsquo;ll have a
quart together then.&nbsp; Come on, lads. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner and Mick took their dismissal and moved <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>off
together.&nbsp; The sun was now high and not a shred of mist
remained in all the river basin.&nbsp; Before this it had seemed
confined on every side by high hills thickly wooded.&nbsp; Now,
to westward, far greater hills arose, huge, bare, and dappled
with shadows of the last retreating clouds.&nbsp; While they
breakfasted Abner had laid out his tobacco to dry in the
sun.&nbsp; They lighted their pipes and walked on cheerily, Mick
singing fragments of a song about the Sultan of the Turks and the
Irish Board of Works.&nbsp; They crossed the river Teme by a
stone bridge above a glassy pool.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m telling
you there&rsquo;s a fine lot of salmon in there,&rsquo; said
Mick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Salmon?&rsquo; asked Abner, who had only been
acquainted with the tinned variety of this fish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Salmon right enough!&rsquo; said Mick, leaning on the
parapet.&nbsp; &lsquo;The times I&rsquo;ve watched them coming up
the river Barrow, before you was the height of a
match!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They left the roofs of Lesswardine on their right, turning in
towards the bare hills.&nbsp; The river swept away from them to
cut the village in two.&nbsp; From a perpendicular tower of
reddish stone they heard a lazy peal of bells.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sunday morning,&rsquo; said Mick.&nbsp; &lsquo;God help
us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>From all that sun-drenched, silent countryside, from the
towers of many hidden villages other bells were heard,
melancholy, mellow voices, floating luxuriously in an air
lightened by rain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the houly!&rsquo; Mick continued, &lsquo;and the
pubs shut on me!&nbsp; If it isn&rsquo;t enough to make a man
make dead childer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They passed three villages in which closed doors confirmed
this gloomy reflection.&nbsp; The villages themselves were not
gloomy.&nbsp; Leisure, prosperity and content radiated from their
flowery gardens, from the clean pinafores and collars of the
children loitering to church, from the faces of the men who
gossiped at the gates of sunny gardens in their
shirt-sleeves.&nbsp; In no part of England could villages more
trimly English have been found than in this ultimate border of
the Marches.&nbsp; It was as though the nearness of another and
an alien civilisation compelled them to insist on their national
character.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&lsquo;In Wales,&rsquo; said Mick, sourly,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s divil a one open Sunda&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They crossed another river, the noisy Barbel, a torrent of
mountain water wherein no weeds could grow, swirling clear into
black pools.&nbsp; A stone set in the middle of the bridge told
them that they were now in Wales, and as though to emphasise the
change of country the barren hill-sides rose abruptly to receive
them; on their right a tremendous crag of gray stone crowned with
a pointed earthwork, and in front of them fold on fold of softer
contours pale in the sunlight from the intricate convolutions of
which the brawling river issued.</p>
<p>A village of stone awaited them, blank house-walls fronting on
the roadway with small windows and roofs of clumsy slate.&nbsp;
In the midst an ugly chapel, with the word &lsquo;Ebenezer&rsquo;
carved above its doorway, from which the sound of a drawling hymn
emerged, and at the end of the village a public-house with the
painted head of a bison for sign and, as Mick had anticipated,
closed doors.&nbsp; Even the windows were shuttered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see if there&rsquo;s annything
stirrin&rsquo;, said Mick, beating at the door.</p>
<p>For a time they could get no answer, but at last the door was
cautiously opened and the head of an old man appeared.&nbsp; How
old he was it would have been difficult to say, for though his
eyes were rheumy and the irises ringed with the white circles of
age, his hair was plentiful and scarcely streaked with
gray.&nbsp; He leaned on a stick and did not seem pleased to see
them, speaking in a tongue that Abner could scarcely
understand.&nbsp; When they told him that Wigan Joe had sent them
he became a little more hospitable, but the consciousness of a
Wesleyan policeman in the village still prevented him from
opening the door to them.&nbsp; The foreman of the water-works
job, he said, whose name was Eve, could certainly be found at the
Pound House at Mainstone, three miles away over the river.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s in England,&rsquo; he mumbled, as though he
were speaking of a barbarous foreign country.&nbsp; As to
lodgings he could not help them.&nbsp; On Tuesday the cloggers
were coming over from Lesswardine and had arranged to take his
two rooms.&nbsp; Mick pressed him, and he admitted <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>that, at a
pinch, his wife might be able to put them up until then, provided
that they were in a position to pay for a room and food.&nbsp;
Abner assured him that that was all right, but he still refused
to commit himself till Mrs Malpas returned from chapel.&nbsp; As
a favour he allowed them at last to leave their bundles with him
while they set off again to find the foreman.&nbsp; They promised
to return to Chapel Green in the evening, and before they turned
their backs he had closed the door again with evident relief.</p>
<p>They reached Mainstone just before the opening of the Pound
House.&nbsp; The foreman Eve, whom his associates called Gunner,
a little man who wore a shield over the socket from which one of
his eyes was missing, told them that they need not want for a job
if they meant business and told them to apply to the clerk of the
works early on Monday morning.&nbsp; &lsquo;You say Mr Eve sent
you and it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the end of this
sentence he was snatched away by a power beyond his control, for
the doors of the ale-house opened and the twenty or thirty men
who had been lounging outside flowed into the bar like metal into
a mould.</p>
<p>It was a clean and pleasant place surrounded by settles of
black Welsh oak.&nbsp; The presence of the navvies from the
waterworks had made it into a kind of recognised canteen, and
behind the bar were ranged three great barrels of Astill&rsquo;s
ales.&nbsp; Even at a distance of eighty miles from North
Bromwich the power of Astill&rsquo;s influence was felt.&nbsp;
Mick, without any difficulty, had already enrolled himself as a
member of the company.&nbsp; He had paired off with a big
lumbering fellow in corduroys with a red, stupid face and curly
hair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s going to give the ball a kick?&rsquo; Abner
heard him saying, and a moment later he was taking a quart pot of
beer from a dark, strapping girl who served behind the
counter.&nbsp; A medley of voices arose: the high-pitched accents
of the Welsh, the soft Hereford burr, a smattering of audacious
cockney, and then the harsher northern speech of a number of
cloggers who had wandered in.&nbsp; The room was crowded to
suffocation, and Abner found himself lucky to get a seat
alongside the one-eyed foreman, Eve, on a bench <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>near to the
window.&nbsp; Abner began to talk to him, but the Gunner was not
inclined to keep it up.&nbsp; He was a little man with firm-set
jaws from which speech seemed to escape with difficulty.&nbsp;
His whole body was spare and dessicated and his skin so tanned
with exposure to weather that the blue-black patterns tattooed on
his forearms were scarcely distinguishable from his skin.&nbsp;
He drank rum and water stolidly with a little cough between each
gulp and scrutinised all the company with his one eye that was
dark and keen like that of a bird of prey.&nbsp; He drank three
or four rums, one after the other, but the process had no
loosening effect on his taciturnity, nor did it dim the
brightness of his eye.&nbsp; Abner asked him how long he had been
on the waterworks job.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fourteen year,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it like to last long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s like to last as long as I do.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m what you might call on the establishment, as they say
in the service.&nbsp; Been with it since they made the
resservoyer in the Dulas valley.&nbsp; They say it&rsquo;s an
unlucky job this here water.&nbsp; I was there when the dam was
broke nine year ago.&nbsp; Always something up with it. .
.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, warming a little, he began to ask Abner if he were used
to navvying work, snorted when he told him he was a miner, and
told him that he&rsquo;d have a job to get a bed to sleep
in.&nbsp; &lsquo;The cloggers is coming into the Buffalo
Tuesday,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and the folk round here is scared
of us.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re like children with strangers.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re a lot of damned Welshmen, only don&rsquo;t you tell
&rsquo;em so or they&rsquo;ll let you know about it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He waved to the dark girl behind the counter, who brought him
another tot of spirit as though she understood his signal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re looking up fine to-day, Susie,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get away with you, Mr Eve,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
She may have blushed, but the blood ran so richly under her brown
cheeks that no blush could have been seen.&nbsp; Eve took hold of
her arm and pulled her gently towards him.&nbsp; Evidently she
was used to being handled, for she did not seem to resent
it.&nbsp; With her dark hair almost brushing the foreman&rsquo;s
cheek she winked at Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Badger been down to-day,&rsquo; said Eve in a
whisper.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>&lsquo;Oh, you <i>are</i> a tease,&rsquo; she said,
with a movement of petulance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, do let me
go!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not the only gentleman that wants
serving.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eve gently pinched her arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;just you ask George Malpas to come and have a word
with me, there&rsquo;s a good girl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She left them, pushing her way familiarly through the crowd of
men with a refined &lsquo;Excuse me!&rsquo; and crossed the room
towards a tall, dark young man, better dressed than most of the
company, who stood holding a pot of ale in the opposite corner,
and talking to Wigan Joe, who had just arrived.&nbsp; When the
girl spoke to him he nodded, and a moment later came over to the
bench on which Abner and the foreman were sitting.&nbsp; From the
very first Abner liked his face, and indeed he was a handsome
specimen of the border type, with an olive skin and dark eyes set
rather wide apart under level brows.&nbsp; At the moment his
cheeks were a little flushed with the liquor that he had been
drinking.</p>
<p>He and the Gunner were evidently old friends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, George,&rsquo; said Eve, &lsquo;how goes
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Middling, Gunner, middling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, my son, hark to me.&nbsp; This young chap here is
coming on to our job to-morrow . . . a mining chap from North
Bromwich way . . . and he wants to find a lodge.&nbsp; Think you
can do something for him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, now you&rsquo;m asking!&rsquo; said George
Malpas.&nbsp; &lsquo;The cloggers are coming into the Buffalo
Tuesday; but I reckon mother might find him a bed time they
come.&nbsp; &lsquo;T&rsquo;is all accarding. . . .&nbsp; Not that
her won&rsquo;t be glad to oblige you, Gunner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a mate along of me,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your mate looks more like sleeping in a ditch,&rsquo;
said the Gunner with a dour glance at Mick.&nbsp; &lsquo;Irishmen
are all alike.&nbsp; God, don&rsquo;t I know &rsquo;em!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been shipmates with one or two of them chaps in my
time.&nbsp; Well, George?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do,&rsquo; said George
Malpas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your mother ought to be glad of a decent
chap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll take him along with me when they
close, don&rsquo;t you fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He moved off again towards the bar.&nbsp; At the same <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>moment
there appeared in the doorway a man of middle height and sturdy
build.&nbsp; He was dressed in a cord shooting coat and
breeches.&nbsp; His face was swarthy and sanguine and he surveyed
the company as though he had a grudge against every one of
them.&nbsp; Indeed he had reason to be suspicious, for if black
glances could have killed he would have been a dead man within a
minute of entering the room.&nbsp; He stood there as if he were
waiting for the hostility of the bar to take some more tangible
form, and at last a young man emerging from a pint pot with an
accession of Dutch courage, said mildly: &lsquo;Well, Mr Badger,
how be the young pheasants going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you ask him,&rsquo; said another.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This be a terrible place for foxes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The keeper took no notice of these remarks nor yet of the
laughter that followed; he went straight up to the counter where
Susie stood polishing glasses and shook hands with her
formally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rsquo; asked Mick Connor, already
considerably nourished, &lsquo;A keeper?&nbsp; You leave go of
him, darlin&rsquo;.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d as well be shaking hands
with the divil!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d best hold your tongue,&rsquo; said
another.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;m our Susie&rsquo;s
fancy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gard be good to her then!&rsquo; said Mick with a
sigh.</p>
<p>Neither Badger nor the girl seemed to be conscious of these
reflections on their intimacy.&nbsp; Badger was leaning over the
bar with his face close to hers and whispering.&nbsp; She still
went on polishing her glasses mechanically, nodding with pursed
lips, in response to whatever he was saying and glancing from
time to time in a mirror, advertising Astill&rsquo;s Bottled
Ales, that hung on the wall at her right hand.&nbsp; Evidently
all was not well, for she hurriedly rearranged a curl of dark
hair that hung in front of her right ear and had become entangled
in a garnet ear-ring.&nbsp; This process of preening attracted
Abner&rsquo;s attention to her sex.&nbsp; Suddenly he found
himself comparing her rather maturer charms with those of Susan
Wade.&nbsp; Perhaps her name had something to do with it.&nbsp;
Both were of the dark beauty which had always attracted him,
though Susan the first had been a pale city-dweller and little <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>more than a
girl, while the barmaid was a woman of his own age, generously
yet perfectly formed, full of strength and health and physical
splendour.&nbsp; She bent over to listen more carefully to the
keeper&rsquo;s whisper that was almost lost in the hubbub of the
taproom, and Abner saw the smooth whiteness of her neck, faintly
browned like an egg.&nbsp; The liquor that he had taken inflamed
his imagination.&nbsp; For the moment she seemed definitely
desirable.</p>
<p>Mick Connor, having kicked as many drinks out of his
neighbours as they would give him, staggered over to
Abner&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; In this state he looked more than ever
like a bird.&nbsp; His small eyes glistened and the arteries of
his temples stood out like whipcord.&nbsp; He asked Abner for
money, and when Abner said, quite truthfully, that he had none to
spare, he began to round on him fiercely in a language that
nobody could understand.&nbsp; It seemed as if a row were in the
making, and this was the last thing that Abner wished for.&nbsp;
He didn&rsquo;t want to be involved with Mick in a dispute before
the foreman, Eve, who stared critically at his friend, and
particularly before the girl who stood behind the counter.&nbsp;
He tried to lead Mick away before it was too late, but the
Irishman wrenched himself free from his hands and began to take
off his coat for a fight.&nbsp; The whole room was now listening
and laughing at the scene.&nbsp; The girl behind the bar, seeing
that things were getting serious, excused herself to the keeper
and came down to ask Abner to take his friend away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t have this sort of thing in here, you
know,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>She came so near to Abner that he was aware of the smell of
her hair.&nbsp; Her nearness disturbed him so that he could
scarcely answer her.&nbsp; Mick, however, found no difficulty in
stating his case at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; she said, with the air of one who was
used to the settling of such complications.&nbsp; &lsquo;You two
boys had better go out and get a bit of fresh air.&nbsp; Go on
now, be good chaps,&rsquo; she continued good-humouredly,
&lsquo;or I shall have to call father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mick turned on her savagely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Call your father, is
it?&nbsp; Who said I was drunk?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&lsquo;I never said you was drunk.&nbsp; Just you sit
down and be quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time Badger had reached her side.&nbsp; &lsquo;Best
leave him alone, Susie,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Half-past
six, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, and the keeper went out.&nbsp; At the same moment
the landlord of the house, a short, wheezy man, with yellow
pockets under his eyes that made him look like an owl, appeared
behind the bar, and shouted to Susie in a high-pitched voice,
asking what was the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, dad,&rsquo; she said, smiling
back at Abner, who had by this time succeeded in pushing Mick
Connor down into the seat next to the foreman and thrusting his
own unfinished pot of beer into his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what&rsquo;s all the bloody noise about?&rsquo; Mr
Hind inquired, with a violent wheeze at the end of the
sentence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t forget we&rsquo;ve got a new
policeman here that&rsquo;s a stranger to the ways of the place,
and the justices lying in wait for me.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t have
no rows here, or they&rsquo;ll be saying the place isn&rsquo;t
properly conducted.&nbsp; You mind that, boys!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there was no further disturbance.&nbsp; Mick, having
finished the rest of Abner&rsquo;s beer, retired mechanically to
the society of his first friend, the big navvy in corduroys, who
was now too drunk to realise what money he was spending.&nbsp;
The landlord walked to and fro behind the narrow bar, glancing
anxiously at the minute hand of the clock that was gradually
approaching the hour of two, and talked wheezily about his
distrust of the new policeman.&nbsp; Through the little door of
the kitchen behind the bar came the frizzle of a basted joint
followed by the metallic clang of an oven door.&nbsp; Something
savoury was doing for dinner.&nbsp; The clock gave a whirring
noise which suggested that it was as asthmatic as its owner and
struck two with a harsh, ringing note.&nbsp; The landlord stopped
dead in his prowling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Time . . .&rsquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See you Monday,&rsquo; said the Gunner, winking at
Abner, who was already preparing to rescue Mick Connor from his
new friend.&nbsp; The bar emptied.&nbsp; In the space of two
hours its atmosphere had become so thick with tobacco smoke and
the fumes of liquor that it smelt <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>stale and fetid.&nbsp; Mick was
walking arm in arm with the navvy in a state of unstable
equilibrium.&nbsp; Abner took his arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
on,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see about the
lodge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who the hell are you?&rsquo; said the Irishman
truculently.&nbsp; &lsquo;You keep a civil distance!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The big man rallied to his supporter, and Abner saw that for
the present Mick was best left alone.&nbsp; The other two went
off together, Mick singing a song in which the navvy joined
though he did not know the tune.&nbsp; A tall policeman with
mutton-chop whiskers watched them from the other side of the
road.&nbsp; Abner turned and saw that the young man whom the
Gunner had addressed as George Malpas was waiting for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Best come along of me to the Buffalo and have a
bite,&rsquo; he said, and they set off together.</p>
<p>Abner found that from the first he liked George Malpas.&nbsp;
His dark face and eyes were bright with the drink that he had
taken, his speech rapid and vivacious.&nbsp; They walked quickly
towards Chapel Green and the hills, talking all the way, and
Abner felt that this was the first person whom he had met on his
travels who really accepted him with naturalness and without
suspicion.&nbsp; Malpas told him that he need not worry about his
lodging.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dad&rsquo;s getting up in years,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;and a shadow&rsquo;d frighten him, but
mother&rsquo;s all there and she don&rsquo;t know how to say
&ldquo;no&rdquo; to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke all the time quickly and with a certain restlessness
that, on the surface, made him seem free and daring.&nbsp; He
questioned Abner eagerly about life in the black-country.&nbsp;
Once he had been in North Bromwich and this experience had made
him discontented with a country life.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
proper dead here, that&rsquo;s what it is!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Time a man gets to my age he ought to see a bit of the
world; but a chap gets nabbed with a wife and a couple of kids
and then it&rsquo;s kiss me good-bye to all that!&nbsp; You
single chaps don&rsquo;t know your luck!&rsquo;&nbsp; Evidently
George Malpas had tried his hand at everything.&nbsp; He had been
a wheelwright; a farm bailiff; for a year or two he had helped
his mother in the management of the Buffalo, and lately, since
the job on the pipe-line had begun, he had been doing
labourer&rsquo;s work: a thing that seemed unnatural to a <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>man so
handsomely and delicately made.&nbsp; &lsquo;Anything for a
change: that&rsquo;s what I say,&rsquo; he maintained.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What a chap like me ought to do is go to sea, but these
old hills are like a prison.&nbsp; Damn me if I wouldn&rsquo;t as
soon be in Shrewsbury jail as here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They crossed the bridge into Wales.&nbsp; By this time George
Malpas&rsquo;s mother had returned from chapel and the door of
the Buffalo was unlocked.&nbsp; George opened it for Abner.&nbsp;
In the bar, on the left, he saw the two bundles exposed
prominently on the table.&nbsp; Beyond in the kitchen they found
the old man sitting in the chimney-corner and Mrs Malpas dredging
flour into the roasting-tin from which a joint of beef had been
taken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just in time, mother!&rsquo; said George.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How&rsquo;s the old legs, dad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Badly . . . badly, George,&rsquo; mumbled his
father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you give us a bite of dinner, mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>At first Mrs Malpas did not reply.&nbsp; She was a little
woman, primly dressed in a constricted black dress.&nbsp; She had
a mass of gray hair with a tinge of yellow in it; her features
were finely shaped, like those of her son, but her mouth was hard
as stone.&nbsp; When she had finished making her gravy she turned
a pair of piercing black eyes on Abner and spoke in a low
voice.&nbsp; It was level and expressionless, but one felt, all
the time, that she meant exactly what she said and that nothing
could turn her from a determination once expressed.&nbsp; Facing
her, he found that her face was beautiful, but hardened by
suffering, by the responsibility of an old and ailing husband and
the anxiety of a wayward son.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this the young man who left his bundle here with
dad?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, this is the chap.&nbsp; All he wants is a
bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t do it, George, and you know I
can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;what with the cloggers
coming, and all!&nbsp; Your father told them so.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
old man nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give us some dinner first, mother,&rsquo; said George
persuasively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then we&rsquo;ll talk about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good talking,&rsquo; Mrs Malpas
persisted.&nbsp; &lsquo;I mean what I said, and so does your
father.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Although it was obvious that nothing that the old man
might say would alter the course of events that she had ordained,
his wife had acquired the habit of pretending that he shared the
responsibility of her decisions.&nbsp; George, with a side glance
of encouragement at Abner, tried to joke her out of her
seriousness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t get over me that way, George,&rsquo;
she said; but when he took her arm her eyes and mouth softened
and she made no attempt to prevent Abner sharing the meal which
her son helped her to put on the table.&nbsp; At the end of the
process he kissed her, and she suddenly stiffened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been to the Pound House, George!&nbsp; I
can smell your breath.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, can&rsquo;t a chap go to the Pound House without
a fuss being made?&rsquo; he laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;m
jealous, mother, of that seven days&rsquo; licence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it was to make my fortune this minute,&rsquo; she
said intensely, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t sell one spot of drink on
a Sunday.&nbsp; Nor would father,&rsquo; she added in a milder
tone.</p>
<p>The flash subsided and she went on to ask about Mr
Hind&rsquo;s asthma; but she took no notice of George&rsquo;s
reply, for her inquiry had only been a preliminary to asking how
Susie was.&nbsp; She watched him closely when he replied that
Susie was all right.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her new friend Badger was
there,&rsquo; he added with a laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mind the time,&rsquo; said the old man dreamily,
&lsquo;when there was three badgers dug out one month up the
Castel Ditches.&nbsp; Turrible teeth a badger has.&nbsp; Turrible
. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He means Mr Badger, the keeper, father,&rsquo; said Mrs
Malpas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All keepers is the same,&rsquo; said the old man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Water or game-keepers, there&rsquo;s not a pin between
&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He relapsed into one of those fits of vacuity which often
droused his normal, if senile, intelligence.&nbsp; Mrs Malpas
dragged him back with the announcement that the dinner was
ready.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and draw some beer,&rsquo; said
George.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort, George,&rsquo;
replied Mrs Malpas.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve had all
that&rsquo;s good for you at the <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Pound House.&nbsp; If your father
can do without beer before evening, so can you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>George passed the reproof off with a smile, but stayed where
he was.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mrs Malpas rescued four hot plates from the oven and
thrust them into Abner&rsquo;s hands with &lsquo;Catch on,
please!&rsquo; and the party settled down at the table, the old
man occupying a shiny chair with a patchwork cushion; the mother,
rigid as her own chair-back, facing him, Abner and George
disposed on either side of them.&nbsp; The food was excellent and
Abner was more than ready for it.&nbsp; It was the first square
meal that he had got his teeth into for a week.&nbsp; Mrs
Malpas&rsquo;s appetite was in keeping with the ascetic character
of her face, but the old man ate ravenously of beef, vegetables,
and dumplings, and the two others were not far behind him.&nbsp;
All through the meal Mrs Malpas cast anxious glances at her
son&rsquo;s plate.&nbsp; Abner could see that beneath her mask of
severity she was really full of a fierce maternal concern for his
comfort.&nbsp; The only tokens of tenderness that ever appeared
in her were shown towards him.&nbsp; When she spoke of
George&rsquo;s wife and of the children there was an almost
imperceptible hardening in her tone, and George answered her
shortly, as if he knew that the subject had only been raised for
politeness&rsquo; sake.</p>
<p>For all this they enjoyed their meal.&nbsp; The room was dim,
for the hot sun from outside was caught in the folds of a lace
curtain and a mass of lush geranium plants with which the
window-sill was crowded.&nbsp; The scent of their leaves filled
the room with an atmosphere of summer, languid and happy.&nbsp;
One could almost have guessed that it was Sunday.</p>
<p>When the meal was over Abner began to fill his pipe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No smoking in here, young man,&rsquo; said Mrs Malpas
sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you want to smoke you&rsquo;d best go
into the tap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s fancy on a Sunday,&rsquo;
George apologised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know your father can&rsquo;t abear it,&rsquo; said
Mrs Malpas, but the old man, who usually woke up when his name
was mentioned, did not hear her, being busy with a paper packet
of snuff.</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>When
she began to clear the table, George returned gallantly to the
subject of their visit.&nbsp; &lsquo;What about this chap&rsquo;s
lodging?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good asking me, George.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
told you once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can give him a bed till Tuesday while he&rsquo;s
looking round, mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head positively.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
clean things up between now and Tuesday.&nbsp; Besides,
there&rsquo;s two of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you trouble yourself about the
other,&rsquo; said George.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone off with
one of our gang.&nbsp; This is a nice, steady chap. .
.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs Malpas did not budge.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your father
wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it,&rsquo; she said finally.&nbsp; By this
time she had cleared away the dinner things, taken off her apron
and placed a family Bible with a blue silk marker on the
table.&nbsp; Mr Malpas had settled back in his chair by the
hearth with a snuffy handkerchief over his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just for two days,&rsquo; said George.</p>
<p>&lsquo;George, &rsquo;tis no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He knew better than to press her under the circumstances, and
so they prepared to go.&nbsp; Abner took out his money to pay for
the meal.&nbsp; Cupidity struggled with principle in Mrs
Malpas&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not on a Sunday, young man,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Abner thanked her clumsily.&nbsp; George kissed her, and for a
moment she dropped her stiffness and clung to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on, then,&rsquo; he said to Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good-bye, dad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Mr Malpas was already asleep, his mouth sagging beneath
the edge of his handkerchief.&nbsp; Abner picked up his bundle in
the taproom and he and George went out into the grilling
sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Malpas</span>, having taken a fancy
to Abner at first sight, had determined to ask his own wife to

had begun with a quick, spontaneous liking on either side.&nbsp;
Abner was only too glad to see a friendly face, not being built,
as was Mick Connor, for picaresque adventure, and feeling that it
would be well to settle down again.&nbsp; George Malpas, on the
other hand, liked him because he represented something new,
because he had exhausted the possibilities of the cloggers&rsquo;
company, which led no farther than the Pound House&mdash;a place
which he could only visit with irritation since Badger, the
keeper, had cut him out with Susie Hind&mdash;and because the
idea of a presentable stranger living in his own house appealed
to him on the score of variety as well as from the financial
point of view.</p>
<p>As they left the Buffalo, George expounded his project to
Abner.&nbsp; It did him good, he said, to talk, and particularly
to talk to a man of his own age who could understand him.&nbsp;
If Abner had been married he would have realised that it was
useless talking to women who pretended to listen, but never gave
a thought to what a man was saying.&nbsp; The thought of his
marriage always roused him to bitterness.&nbsp; It had been
imposed on him, indeed, by the anxiousness of his mother, who
adored him, her only son, beyond words and, under the influence
of chapel, had conceived it her particular duty to save his soul
from hell.&nbsp; Hell, in the eyes of Mrs Malpas, meant neither
more nor less than sexual promiscuity, and seeing in the
handsomeness of George a spiritual danger, she had followed the
advice of St Paul and married him safely, as she thought, before
worse happened.</p>
<p>She herself had chosen a wife for him.&nbsp; Indirectly, for
she knew that he was wilful and easily scared, she had contrived
to make him fall in love with the daughter of a local
farm-bailiff, Morgan Condover, a steady, and, as <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>it seemed,
a solid man, who managed the outlying members of the Powys
estate.&nbsp; Mary Condover, the daughter, was a little older
than George; a shy beauty, with whom the lad soon fell in
love.&nbsp; George, as the only son of the innkeeper at Chapel
Green, was considered a good match, and Mrs Malpas played her
cards so well that within six months of falling in love George
found himself married and installed in a house of his own.&nbsp;
He was happy: Mrs Malpas could see that for herself, and she
thanked Heaven that she had been permitted to save her son
alive.</p>
<p>Before a year was over George&rsquo;s first child was
born.&nbsp; There was a great christening party at Wolfpits at
which old Mr Condover, having drunk a good deal more than Mrs
Malpas approved, confided to her that his newly-born
grand-daughter, whom they had christened Gladys, would take the
first place in his will.&nbsp; This was exactly what Mrs Malpas
had intended from the first, and her satisfaction was so deep
that she could almost have forgiven the bailiff his lapse from
sobriety in spite of the unfortunate example that he had given to
his son-in-law.&nbsp; The intense thankfulness that flooded her
heart when she saw George so happily and satisfactorily bound in
the chains of domesticity atoned for the troubles that were
crowding on her own life.&nbsp; Her husband, who had been ailing
for some years, was smitten with a stroke of paralysis from which
he never fully recovered.&nbsp; She knew that hard times were
coming but faced them cheerfully.&nbsp; For many years Mr Malpas
had meant less to her as a husband than as the father of her
son.&nbsp; She would do her duty by him&mdash;nobody could
suggest that she had ever done less&mdash;on the surface she
would acknowledge him still as the head of her household, but his
illness would give her the opportunity of managing the business
to her own liking and scraping together, in the years that
remained to them, a little money that, added to the small fortune
of which Mr Condover had boasted to her at the christening,
should make her son secure for life.&nbsp; She even hoped that he
might succeed Mr Condover in the care of the Powys estate.</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>Her
<i>Nunc dimittis</i> was premature.&nbsp; Just before the birth
of George&rsquo;s second child, a healthy boy whom they had
decided to name Morgan after his grandfather, Mr Condover, at the
very height of his prosperity, hanged himself in an
outhouse.&nbsp; His death revealed the fact that the money of
which he had boasted at the first christening did not
exist.&nbsp; It soon appeared that he had defrauded the Powys
estate of more than eight hundred pounds, and rumour said that he
had been involved with some woman in Ludlow.&nbsp; This was a
terrible blow to Mrs Malpas, for in remote country places the
shames of the fathers are visited on the children to the third
generation, and never forgotten.&nbsp; When the baby was born she
begged her daughter-in-law not to give the child his
grandfather&rsquo;s name; but Mary, who had loved her father,
obstinately persisted, and Mrs Malpas could never hear it without
feeling that it carried with it a reproach.&nbsp; She tried to
persuade George to change it, but George did not care.&nbsp; He
was no longer in love with his wife, who now stood to him for a
symbol of the chains that his mother had imposed on him.&nbsp; He
felt that she had cheated him out of an enjoyment of life that
was his due.&nbsp; At any cost he meant to regain his freedom,
and Mary and his mother were the sufferers.&nbsp; The wife,
indeed, had the care of her children to console her for
George&rsquo;s neglect; but the mother, against whom he nursed a
deep, indefinite grudge as the author of all his misfortunes,
found that she must bear the responsibility of her own
schemes.</p>
<p>The household at Wolfpits now missed the subsidies which Mr
Condover had generously distributed from his masters&rsquo;
money.&nbsp; George had drifted into an extravagant way of life
that he had no intention of changing.&nbsp; Partly because of his
expansive nature, and partly because, in truth, he had never had
his fling, George found it difficult to settle to any steady
work.&nbsp; He became a drain upon the resources of the Buffalo,
and Mrs Malpas, who found it hard to refuse him anything, was
forced to draw upon her savings to support him.&nbsp; In her
irritation and despair she blamed Mary for all this, thinking of
her as a feckless housewife who had been brought up in the lavish
ways of her father.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&lsquo;The bad blood&rsquo;s in her and is bound to
come out,&rsquo; she said, airing her grievances on Mr Malpas who
now cared for nothing but his food.&nbsp; George did not mind who
was to blame as long as he got the money that he wanted.&nbsp; He
was beginning to be interested in other women, particularly, for
a little while, in Susie Hind, the daughter of the proprietor of
the Pound House, an inn which Mrs Malpas had always regarded as
the Buffalo&rsquo;s bitterest rival.&nbsp; It pained her beyond
words to think that her hard-earned savings should find their way
into Mr Hind&rsquo;s till.</p>
<p>&lsquo;George,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if only you&rsquo;ll
keep away from that there place I&rsquo;ll see what I can do for
you.&nbsp; Or if only you&rsquo;d settle to regular work. .
.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you kindly!&rsquo; said George.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you let me take on the licence of the Buffalo now
that dad can&rsquo;t do it justice?&nbsp; Then you and dad could
go and live somewhere quiet as you&rsquo;ve a right to do at your
age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, George!&rsquo; she said intensely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Never. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed at her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t trust you,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The man that keeps a public ought to be teetotal.&nbsp; I
know what would happen to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve never give me a chance,&rsquo; he
protested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m not going to,&rsquo; she
maintained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a job I&rsquo;m cut out for.&nbsp; I like
company.&nbsp; I could double your business in a
month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And drink yourself dead in six,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve never seen me drunk, mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I know you, my son!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m dead sick of this country,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Town&rsquo;s the place for me.&nbsp; If I
could get away out of this and make a fresh start.&nbsp; Damn me
if I won&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, George!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
never heard your father use a word like that in his
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the thing that she was really frightened of was that he
should go.&nbsp; He was the only thing left to her, and if he
went all light would have gone from her life.&nbsp; She
controlled her tears and took him into the little bedroom where,
in an oak chest, she kept her savings.&nbsp; She gave him money,
and he left her, contented, kissing her with an affection that
was mingled faintly with <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>pity.&nbsp; When she held him in her
arms all her tense anxiety for a moment disappeared.&nbsp; She
could only think of him as the son of her body in whose happiness
and physical welfare she delighted.&nbsp; It seemed to her that
she could now only purchase these precious moments with money,
but for a little while she could forget this in the joy that he
gave her.</p>
<p>Time after time he begged her to let him take on the business,
but she always refused him, sheltering herself, as her habit now
was, behind the negligible personality of her husband.&nbsp; It
would have shocked her beyond words if George had pointed out to
her that his father didn&rsquo;t count, and that her
consideration for him was a pretence; but George knew better than
to vex her in this way, for the key of the chest upstairs was
kept in her pocket.&nbsp; What is more, even though their two
wills were always in conflict, he loved his mother.&nbsp; She
meant a great deal more to him than Mary had ever done except in
the first blindness of his passion, and for this reason, no less
than for the other, he was tolerant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you take no notice of mother,&rsquo; he
told Abner as they walked along together.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s got a funny way with her, but she&rsquo;s all
right at the bottom.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not many women could
have done what she has.&nbsp; The only bad turn she ever done me
was when she got me threw over the pulpit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the third time in their walk that George had spoken
grudgingly of his wife, but this did not strike Abner as strange,
for it was exactly the attitude not only of his father but of
most of the men with whom he had worked at Mawne.&nbsp; He
grunted sympathetically in answer to George&rsquo;s complaints,
and all the time, as Malpas eagerly expounded his own aspirations
towards freedom and adventure, they were climbing gradually,
passing by many gyrations of a narrow road into the curve of the
hills in which Wolfpits lay.</p>
<p>Within a mile of Chapel Green the character of the country
changed.&nbsp; Before that only a hint of mountainous severity
had been visible in the stone buildings of the village with their
narrow windows and their cruel roofs of slate.&nbsp; At Chapel
Green the pastures that lay beside the river were not greatly
different <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>from the water-meadows of Teme, which is an English
river, but the fields through which the road to Wolfpits passed
were poor and of a paler green.&nbsp; Their hedges were scanty,
writhen and knotted with hard life.&nbsp; The generous elms grew
fewer, standing stunted, forsaken and sparing of leaf.&nbsp; They
seemed to shiver with poverty in this alien soil.&nbsp; In their
place the hardier mountain trees appeared: birches that quivered
even in this tranquil air: oak and holly and yew crouching in the
hedgerow sombrely but crowned with waxen honeysuckle.&nbsp; These
poor fields seemed to feel the pressure of the hills on either
side from the slopes of which blown spores of bracken and seeds
of gorse had settled and thriven like hill-men in a rich
plain.&nbsp; In the midst of the fields smooth water-worn
boulders were scattered, and through the pit of the valley a
noisy tributary of the Barbel, that Abner came to know as the
Folly Brook, set up an unceasing murmur like that of a
thunder-shower on summer leaves behind a dense curtain of
green.</p>
<p>Still the road climbed.&nbsp; It rose in bold curves, like a
kestrel soaring, into colder air.&nbsp; Sometimes the brook
flowed near it, and Abner could see through gaps in the arras of
alders roaring stickles of bright water.&nbsp; Sometimes it swept
away from them, hugging the foot of the hills, sounding no more
than the evening breeze in a poplar tree.&nbsp; Gullies that fed
it scored the road with tracks of winter torrents.&nbsp; At that
season of the year no moving water could be seen, but once or
twice in shadier places slow moisture oozed and dripped from beds
of mosses on the banks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The cloggers is coming up the Folly when they&rsquo;ve
finished down Lesswardine way,&rsquo; said George.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
reckon they&rsquo;ll liven things up a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The road grew rougher; it seemed to falter in its purpose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where do you get to this way?&rsquo; Abner asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right up into the Forest and on to Clun, but not many
uses it,&rsquo; said George.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Clun men
don&rsquo;t come much over our way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a stiffish
bit of collar-work.&nbsp; This here&rsquo;s Wolfpits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The road swept up obliquely to a crest and then <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>sank to the
level of the stream.&nbsp; Abner had a vision of the whole valley
expanding into a kind of amphitheatre through the middle of which
the little river pursued a more leisurely course, winding gently
through the fields as though it rejoiced to linger under the open
sky.&nbsp; On either side the mountains rose to their full
height, no longer concealed by foothills: from lip to lip the cup
was roofed with dazzling blue.&nbsp; In the open space beneath,
an avenue of chestnuts led upwards from the river to a great red
house fronted with three pointed gables and crowned by clusters
of fantastic chimney-stacks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that one?&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s Wolfpits,&rsquo; George replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Looks all right, don&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As they descended the house was lost from sight and George
began to explain that Wolfpits had once been a great house, the
most westerly possession of the family whom Condover, his
father-in-law, had served, but that the pastures which surrounded
it, for all their greenness were poor and the mansion itself too
remote and gloomy for gentlefolks to inhabit in this age of
comfort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They say it&rsquo;s ha&rsquo;nted, too,&rsquo; he
declared, with a laugh, &lsquo;though I don&rsquo;t pay no heed
to such stories.&nbsp; I reckon it stood here empty for close on
a hundred years till Mary&rsquo;s father got Mr McKellar, the
agent, to let it off in pieces to them that wanted houses.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s more than five farms up this valley lying empty for
the want of a bit of work putting into them, but the old lord was
so took up with his new model village down by Lesswardine, he
hadn&rsquo;t the money to put into the old ones.&nbsp; Not that I
grumble at him. . . .&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a good solid house to live
in.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s three families in it now, and room for
four more in my opinion.&nbsp; And I reckon I&rsquo;ve a kind of
right to it,&rsquo; he went on; &lsquo;the Malpases was big
people in these parts at one time.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find their
names on the vault in Lesswardine church.&nbsp; <i>John
Malpas</i>, <i>Gentleman</i>, that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s
written.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a Reverent Cyril Malpas rector of
Aston to this day.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s father went into the family
history at the time we was married.&nbsp; The Condovers is an old
family too.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>These
claims to a faded aristocracy did not interest Abner, but he
could not help being impressed by the size of the house as they
approached it through the shade of the chestnut avenue.&nbsp; It
was built of small red bricks, strange to the country but now
beautifully weathered by time.&nbsp; The eastern end was covered
with a gigantic growth of ivy, but from the western side, which
they were approaching, the parasite had been stripped on Mr
Condover&rsquo;s advice and the red wall glowed as though it were
exuding the imprisoned sunshine of three centuries.&nbsp; In this
generous light one did not notice an air of desolation which the
uncurtained upper windows gave to it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All that&rsquo;s wrong with this old place,&rsquo; said
George, &lsquo;is the rats.&nbsp; But I reckon you&rsquo;ve been
sleeping rough and won&rsquo;t notice them.&nbsp; This is our
garden.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s a great one for flowers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had entered a drive that swept up in a spacious curve to
the steps of the front-door, an entrance which had been closed
for many years.&nbsp; In place of the lawns that had once been
the pride of its inhabitants lay three long strips of garden,
each carefully tilled and separated from its neighbour by a fence
of wire netting, the remains of some dismantled fowl-run.&nbsp; A
path of bricks, salved from one of the dilapidated stables of the
mansion, ran down the middle of the nearest garden-patch, and in
the centre of it two children sat playing in the sun, a
fair-haired girl, some six years of age, and a boy, a little
younger, in whose dark features Abner could trace a resemblance
to the handsome face of George Malpas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Them&rsquo;s my youngsters,&rsquo; he said
carelessly.&nbsp; He opened the gate and tweaked the girl&rsquo;s
ear as he passed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, Gladys?&rsquo; he said; but
neither of the children seemed much moved by his arrival, being
more interested in the strange figure of Abner, whose progress up
the path they watched with the vague suspicion of mountain sheep
that stare before they plunge away through heather.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see if the missis is in,&rsquo; said
George.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mary . . .&rsquo; he called.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the girl got to?&nbsp; Sit yourself
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The room had once been the kitchen of the great <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>house.&nbsp; An enormous iron range was built into the
wall on one side, and on the other were racks and shelves which
must once have held many dozens of plates.&nbsp; The sun slanted
through a western window and showed Abner that the comfort of
this stone-paved room lay in its cleanliness.&nbsp; The iron
range was almost handsome in its massive, shining bulk above the
whitened hearth, and in the fender a bundle of green bracken was
set in an attempt at decoration.&nbsp; The fronds of this plant
filled the room with a warm and drowsy odour.&nbsp; In a corner a
grandfather clock, with a solemn face on which the name of
<i>Carver</i>, <i>Hay</i>, was engraved, marked the passage of
time with a slowly swinging pendulum.</p>
<p>George Malpas called his wife again, and from a cool-smelling
chamber on a lower level that might well have been a dairy, a
woman appeared and stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve put the dinner away, George,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s past three
o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry your head about the
dinner,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought this
chap back with me.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s coming to work with us on the
water job.&nbsp; Mother has a fancy she can&rsquo;t take any one
in at the Buffalo, so I&rsquo;ve arranged to give him a lodge
here.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better put him in the top room.&nbsp; I
reckon you won&rsquo;t find him particular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At first she made no reply, but stood looking intently at
Abner.&nbsp; It was difficult for him to believe that she was
George Malpas&rsquo;s wife and the mother of the two children
whom he had seen playing in the garden: she seemed too young, too
slight, little more, indeed, than a young girl.&nbsp; She wore a
clean apron of white linen, still creased from the ironing, and
her straight chestnut hair was bound back plainly on either side
of her temples and braided in heavy plaits behind.</p>
<p>She was tall, and her slimness, together with the narrow
apron, made her appear taller.&nbsp; Her brow was wide and
unwrinkled, her eyes were hazel, her nose straight and slightly
marked with golden freckles.&nbsp; One would have said that her
face represented the most untroubled calm if it had not been that
her mouth was a little sad.&nbsp; <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Only her lips betrayed the fact that
she had suffered.&nbsp; She stood in the shadow and looked at
Abner narrowly but did not speak, for she had known enough
already of George&rsquo;s boon companions to be a little careful
of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stare at the chap like that!&rsquo; said
George irritably, &lsquo;or he&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re
cracked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she spoke in a voice that showed more refinement than
could have been expected.&nbsp; Her speech was almost free from
the pleasant burr of the Marches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dare say we can manage,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see about it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she addressed
Abner directly.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn me if I ever thought to ask him!&rsquo; muttered
George.</p>
<p>Abner told her, and she repeated it after him: &lsquo;Abner
Fellows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a queer name,&rsquo; said
Malpas.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind ever having heard it
before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s out of the Bible, George,&rsquo; said his
wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of the Bible, is it?&rsquo; he laughed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s more in your line than mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She left them quietly to attend to the details of
Abner&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; Malpas, still a little restless, took
him out again, talking incessantly and showing him what remained
of the ancient features of Wolfpits: the line of damp stables
with boxes for thirty horses, the yew-trees that had once been
clipped to the shape of peacocks but had now straggled into those
of monstrous antediluvian birds; the red-walled garden, now a
wilderness of nettles, whose fruit trees spilled their pulpy
produce on the mossed paths.&nbsp; From the farthest corner of
the garden they could see the house which, from this angle
appeared tall and narrow like a tower, with chimney-pots for
battlements.&nbsp; In an upper window there appeared the figure
of a woman standing still and gazing out over the mountain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Mary putting your room to rights,&rsquo;
said George, but he did not call to her.</p>
<p>He spoke to Abner of the other inhabitants of Wolfpits.&nbsp;
One was an old woman, Mrs Mamble by name, the widow of a labourer
who had worked on a <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>neighbouring farm.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
don&rsquo;t properly belong to these parts,&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;they came from down Tenbury way, but she&rsquo;s took up
with Morgan and Gladys, and Mary likes her company.&nbsp; He must
have been a good chap in his time, for they give her the house
rent-free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other tenant, whom they saw working in his garden beneath
the ivied end of the house, was another solitary creature, an old
man named Drew who had worked as a farm-labourer in the district
for more than thirty years.&nbsp; He, too, was a foreigner,
having first come to Wolfpits in charge of a pedigree Devon
bull.&nbsp; In the middle period of his life he had been employed
in a flour mill a few miles down the valley of the Folly
Brook.&nbsp; The new steam mills at Lesswardine had robbed him of
this employment, but not before the constant carrying of heavy
sacks had twisted his back to a curve in which rheumatism had
fixed it.&nbsp; Now he could only walk with his shoulders bent so
that when he spoke he had to raise his eyes, staring up at those
who questioned him, as though his back still bore the burden of a
phantom load.&nbsp; All his joints were swollen and knotted with
rheumatism; his huge hands resembled the branches of an ancient
tree and his whole aspect, staring with pale blue eyes beneath a
tangle of reddish hair as yet untouched with gray, was that of a
gnome, and proper to these inaccessible mountains.&nbsp; His life
was lonely, and for this reason he had never lost the uncouth
speech of the South Hams from which he had originally come.&nbsp;
When they passed his garden on their way back George gave him
good-afternoon and he raised himself, as with infinite labour,
from his work, gazing at them with the patient eyes of a yoked
beast of burden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a rum old chap,&rsquo; said George.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You wait till he&rsquo;s on one of his boozing fits, and
then you&rsquo;ll see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time Mary had finished Abner&rsquo;s room and set the
table.&nbsp; The children, tired with play, had come in and were
clamouring for their tea.&nbsp; At the same time the fourth
member of the Malpas family arrived, a yellow lurcher bitch,
named Spider, who had been absent on some dark business of her
own and now returned to gambol with little Morgan on the
floor.&nbsp; <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>The children were never tired of teasing this animal,
but George, who only tolerated her when he himself went rabbiting
in the evening, generally treated her cruelly.&nbsp; The dog
fawned on him, but there was more fear than affection in her
devotion.&nbsp; Abner told them the story of Tiger.&nbsp; The
children listened with wide eyes and the mother looked at him
without speaking.&nbsp; A fire of sticks crackled merrily down in
the room that Abner had taken for a dairy.&nbsp; At last Mary
Malpas brought in tea and the children ate stolidly and shyly,
talking to each other in whispers as though they were disturbed
by the presence of the stranger.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was also the presence of Abner that made George
Malpas take unusual notice of his wife.&nbsp; He treated her very
much as he would have treated the children or the dog when the
fancy took him, but his faintly patronising tone only appeared to
embarrass her.&nbsp; When she gave him his tea he would have
kissed her, but she stiffened slightly and even blushed, so that
Abner could see the colour rising in her white neck.&nbsp; Later
she softened a little from her seriousness and the children too,
realising that Abner was no more than an ordinary mortal, began
to raise their voices.&nbsp; They sat on with the door open in
the mellow evening light, and an atmosphere of homeliness and
quiet descended on the room so happily that Morgan cried when his
mother told him that it was time for bed.&nbsp; During all the
afternoon she had scarcely spoken to Abner, and she seemed
relieved to find a chance of escape.&nbsp; She puzzled him.&nbsp;
In his life he had only known one woman intimately, and that was
Alice.&nbsp; He could not help comparing the two of them.&nbsp;
The cleanliness and refinement of Mary Malpas became exaggerated
by this comparison.&nbsp; Instinctively, at first, he had allowed
himself to be influenced by George&rsquo;s treatment of her, but
her aloofness and reserve now made him feel that she was in some
subtle way superior.&nbsp; He could not say that he liked her;
but he wondered, none the less, what she was made of.</p>
<p>She disappeared upstairs and he and George sat on smoking in
the twilight.&nbsp; The sun had fallen like a plummet behind the
western hills; the valley now lay <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>in deep shadow and only the upper
air was overspread with films of light.&nbsp; Night fell.&nbsp;
Down in the valley a night-jar began his mechanical
trilling.&nbsp; Over by Mawne, in Dovehouse Fields, a hundred
miles away, another night-jar was beginning.&nbsp; A sense of new
and settled happiness descended on Abner.&nbsp; He had come, it
seemed, to another stage in his pilgrimage.&nbsp; Wolfpits was
not like one of the bivouacs in which he had sheltered with Mick
Connor during this crowded week, but a resting place.&nbsp; He
felt that the future need not trouble him, that his feet were
firmly planted on this new soil.&nbsp; The only tie that held him
to the past was the memory of Alice, so strangely awakened by the
presence of this other, and so different, woman.&nbsp; He feared
that there could be no such happiness for her.&nbsp; Lying in bed
in that strange room he decided that as soon as he had earned
some money he would send it to her.&nbsp; At least it was his
duty to return her the two sovereigns that she had slipped into
his pocket when he left her.&nbsp; Yet, when he remembered the
life at Mawne against which he had fretted for so long, his heart
was thankful for this release.&nbsp; He fell asleep.</p>
<h2><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>The
Twelfth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Abner went with George
Malpas to interview the clerk of the works, who engaged him as a
labourer at twenty-two shillings a week off-hand.&nbsp; This man
had been as long on the waterworks job as Gunner Eve
himself.&nbsp; Year after year he had led a nomadic life moving
from one point to another of the great pipe line that stretches
from the valley of the Dulas Fechen to the reservoirs above
Halesby.</p>
<p>The piece of work on which Abner and his friends were now
engaged was no more than the result of one of the last feeble
struggles of the gods of stone against their iron masters.&nbsp;
In this part of its course the pipeline, crossing the swollen
head waters of the Teme, had been lodged upon a deposit of old
red sandstone, a rock that was easily worked and lent itself to
Barradale&rsquo;s plans.&nbsp; A hidden leak, caused possibly by
some obscure subsidence, had distorted its bedding.&nbsp; Two
unsuccessful attempts had been made to deal with it, and now the
engineers had decreed that the whole track must be deflected
northwards for half a mile on to a shelf of harder Silurian
stone.&nbsp; The scene of these new workings was placed at the
mouth of the valley, some three miles below Wolfpits and
immediately under the shadow of two hill bastions: the high peak
which culminated in the earthwork known as Castel Ditches and a
wide hog&rsquo;s back known as Callow hill.</p>
<p>Hither, in the early morning, Abner and George Malpas would
set out together carrying the packets of fried bacon sandwiches
with which Mary supplied them overnight.&nbsp; Spider, eager to
follow them, would watch them go, quivering with anxiety; but
George Malpas had lately taken a dislike to the dog and would
curse her if she moved a step in their direction, throwing a
stone that made her scamper back into the garden.&nbsp; These
morning walks were very pleasant to Abner, and pleasant too was
the sudden change from a green solitude to the sight of working
men who swarmed in <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>the cutting beneath their feet.&nbsp; A trolley way,
crowded with iron trucks that were reddened by rust and by the
sandstone of the Dulas valley from which they had come, cut
through the workings, and beside it ran a deep trough cut ready
to receive the black iron pipes that were dumped along its
edge.&nbsp; Most of the workers were old hands at the game, but
there remained a certain amount of rough digging labour for which
Abner&rsquo;s strength and his experience in the colliery made
him suitable.&nbsp; This was allotted to him by the foreman on
the first day of his employment.</p>
<p>He looked eagerly for Mick Connor, who soon showed himself and
appeared none the worse for the debauch in which he and Curly
Atwell, the huge west-countryman, had engaged.&nbsp; He declared
he was seven pounds better for it, expressing himself as usual in
terms of the race-course, but Abner saw from the first that their
travelling acquaintance was really at an end.</p>
<p>During the day&rsquo;s work he did not even see George Malpas,
being paired, in his new labours, with a youth named Joseph Munn,
whose face was disfigured by a hare-lip.&nbsp; These two were set
to work at some distance from the rest, clearing the sub-soil
from a shelf of rock where a culvert of stone would soon be built
to carry storm water from the slopes of Callow.&nbsp; Chance had
been kind to Abner in the selection of his companion, for it soon
appeared that Joe Munn was a black-country boy who had been born
in Dulston, and in his early days had even seen Abner himself
playing football for Halesby Swifts.&nbsp; He spoke Abner&rsquo;s
own speech, he knew the streets that were familiar to him, and a
common knowledge of distant places is a greater bond between men
than a common knowledge of their fellows.&nbsp; As far as actual
work was concerned Abner might well have had a more satisfactory
partner, for, physically, Munn was a typical product of the
black-country at its worst, pale of face and lank of limb.&nbsp;
He seemed indeed altogether too puny for the work on which they
were engaged, and only a congenital consciousness of being born
to labour induced him to accept a state that made demands above
his strength.&nbsp; Abner would sometimes watch him as he stood
panting <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>with the sweat breaking out in beads along the
unhealthy skin of his bossed forehead and matting the wisps of
his neutral-coloured hair.&nbsp; In the end their partnership
resolved itself into one in which Abner did most of the work when
the foreman was not there.&nbsp; And he did not grudge this, for
he had strength enough for two and so much vigour that he enjoyed
the using of it.&nbsp; Munn would lie down in the sun with his
chin in his hands, watching Abner at work, talking of famous
cup-ties that he had seen, or of the excitements of Dulston
Wakes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you ever come to find yourself
on a job like this,&rsquo; Abner said one day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was company I wanted,&rsquo; Munn explained.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Before I come here I was driving a traction injin down in
Gloucestershire . . . what they call the Forest of Dean.&nbsp;
That was a place, if you like!&nbsp; The other chaps used to go
off into Cinderford and leave me alone with the engine up in
those woods.&nbsp; Lonely . . .!&nbsp; I went half balmy,
straight I did!&nbsp; Yo&rsquo;d never guess what it was
like.&nbsp; I used to start talking to myself for company
like.&nbsp; Ever done that, Abner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner laughed.&nbsp; Of course he had never done that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I went up to the foreman and says: &ldquo;Mister, I
can&rsquo;t stick it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t say no more,
I couldn&rsquo;t . . . trembling like a bloody leaf.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you now?&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wants company,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;What you want
is a nursemaid,&rdquo; says he, and gives me my money on the
Saturday.&nbsp; Then I comes along here.&nbsp; Strike, if I
wasn&rsquo;t glad to get away from all those trees!&nbsp; And
Gunner Eve, he look after me a bit.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a good chap,
the Gunner, ain&rsquo;t he, kid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Working with Abner, or, more exactly, watching Abner work, Joe
Munn recovered a little of his broken spirit; but the story of
its destruction was older than his experience in the silences of
the Forest of Dean.&nbsp; His earliest days had been spent in a
double-back house in a Dulston slum, where, half-fed by an aged
grandmother, he had made the pallid growth of a potato sprouting
in a cellar.&nbsp; Thence he had passed to the children&rsquo;s
ward of Dulston workhouse, being shot out at the age of fourteen
to make his <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>best of the world.&nbsp; Even now he laboured, without
knowing it, under the shadows and suppressions of those early
days.&nbsp; These summer mornings, working with Abner, were the
happiest that he had ever known.&nbsp; They became sound friends
in a partnership wherein Abner was canonised as a hero and
protector, a position which he sustained with an amused
tolerance.</p>
<p>His relation with George Malpas remained equally happy.&nbsp;
They always walked down to work together in the morning, but
after that Abner rarely saw his friend, for Wolfpits held no
attraction for him, and he preferred to take himself, when the
day&rsquo;s work was over, to the Pound House, or sometimes to
the old people at the Buffalo.&nbsp; In a few weeks Abner&rsquo;s
temporary lodging had become a permanency.&nbsp; Mary Malpas, in
consultation with her husband, had settled the sum that he should
pay for bed and keep, and Wolfpits itself, that sinister and
desolate mansion, had become a pleasant and homely place.</p>
<p>At first he never accompanied George on his evening visits to
the Pound House.&nbsp; It pleased him better to walk home up the
valley in the cool of the evening and sluice his head and back
beneath a pump of cold spring water that stood in the deserted
stable-yard.&nbsp; Then Mary would give him his tea, always with
the same air of watchful and remote reserve, and he would smoke
his pipe in the garden, talking to the children who, in the
confidence of their own secret alliance, were gradually becoming
a little more friendly.&nbsp; Or he would play with Spider, who
had now learnt to take a place near his chair at meal times in
the hope of being fed with scraps from Abner&rsquo;s plate.</p>
<p>Sometimes, too, he would lean on the fence watching old Drew
at work in his garden.&nbsp; The old labourer was as hardy as the
knotted oak that he resembled.&nbsp; His day&rsquo;s work began
before dawn: he had more than three miles to walk to the farm on
which he was employed, but when he returned in the evening after
trudging the fields all day, he could never rest, but must be
putting his strip of garden in order so intently that he scarcely
had time to answer Abner&rsquo;s questions, staring up at him
with those patient, <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>over-burdened eyes.&nbsp; His wages,
which were regulated by his age rather than his capacity for
labour, were only twelve shillings a week, so that his garden
produce was really essential to his life.&nbsp; When he had
finished his gardening, or when the light failed, he would retire
to his kitchen and drink a crude, sweet spirit that he distilled
from turnips.&nbsp; Sometimes at night they would hear him
singing to himself the innumerable obscene verses of Devonshire
folk-songs.&nbsp; Then, when he could sing no longer, he would
drag his twisted limbs upstairs and sleep like a log in the
certainty of waking before dawn to set out on his labours
again.&nbsp; His life indeed had been so solitary that he
distrusted any intrusion, and Abner had known him and spoken with
him for many weeks before he felt that his presence was
welcome.</p>
<p>The other tenant of Wolfpits he rarely saw, though her five
years in the old house had made her a confidante of Mary, and
indeed her principal refuge in domestic emergencies.&nbsp;
Sometimes when he came home at night he would find her talking to
Mary in the kitchen, but at the sight of him she scuttled away so
that he saw no more of her than one sees of a rabbit&rsquo;s
vanishing tail.</p>
<p>Mary Malpas did not evade him in this primitive fashion and
yet, even when he had been living at Wolfpits for more than a
month, he felt that he really knew her no better than the
fugitive Mrs Mamble.&nbsp; He could find no parallel to her in
the history of his dealings with Alice at Mawne.&nbsp; The thing
for which Alice had been mostly concerned was her dignity as
mistress of John Fellows&rsquo;s house, and this she had been
active to assert.&nbsp; Mary Malpas, on the other hand, had no
need to stand upon her dignity.&nbsp; It was instinct in the
refinement of her speech and even more in her silence.&nbsp; The
fact that her father had been a swindler and a suicide could
never rob her of it.&nbsp; Abner fancied for a time that the
awkwardness between them was caused by the way in which he had
been suddenly thrust upon her household.&nbsp; He felt that he
might stand to her as a symbol of a new slight inflicted on her
by her husband.&nbsp; Otherwise why should she deny him the least
suspicion of human contact?&nbsp; He even made an awkward attempt
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>to
settle the matter by asking her if she would not be better
pleased if he tried to find another lodging.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I&rsquo;m in the way like,&rsquo; he told her,
&lsquo;just you say so, and I&rsquo;ll be off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you think that?&rsquo; she said, without the
least sign of emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why
you should go away . . . if you are comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t say that they were glad to have him, though
the fact remained that his money was useful to them.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t say that they would be sorry to lose him.&nbsp; He
simply felt that she had made him look foolish, and as this was
the usual result of his dealings with her in spite of her
politeness and her care for his comfort he gave up trying to find
out what she was made of, and settled down to his life at
Wolfpits as though she had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>He had always been fond of dogs and children, and Gladys,
Morgan, and Spider soon became devoted to him.&nbsp; Morgan was
evidently his mother&rsquo;s favourite, and the little girl soon
took a shy but definite fancy to Abner, wandering alone down the
lane in the hope of meeting him on his way home from work and
riding back to Wolfpits perched on his shoulder.&nbsp; She would
watch him gravely while he stripped and swilled himself in the
stableyard, standing by with a towel ready to catch the beads of
water that sparkled on his eyebrows and his hair.&nbsp; Then hand
in hand they would wander round the farmstead, visiting the
pigsties and the barn in which the fowls were housed and
searching for the nests of broody hens in the hedgerows.&nbsp;
She loved above all things to sit upon his shoulder when she
carried home the eggs in the small cup of her hands.&nbsp; She
liked his hugeness and his strength, and rather despised Morgan
for the fact that he was his mother&rsquo;s boy.</p>
<p>In those hills autumn came early, and soon sunset brought with
it a hint of evening cold.&nbsp; The air of the mountains drooped
upon the plain as soon as the western summits hid the sun, and in
a little while their evenings were of lamplight.&nbsp; When Abner
trudged home at night he could see the linnets gathering together
for their autumn flights, hear the whir of their wings <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>and their
tender, reedy notes.&nbsp; Starlings, southward bound, swept the
air in wheeling cohorts, and swifts darted wildly round the
chimneys of Wolfpits.&nbsp; Wood fires were lighted in the
kitchen grate at night, and when Abner had finished his tea he
would settle down on the right hand of the fireplace with a pile
of cut logs at his feet.</p>
<p>At first he looked forward to these evenings with some
anxiety, feeling that the presence of this silent and, as he
thought, unsympathetic woman, would make him uncomfortable; but
strangely enough this did not happen.&nbsp; The devotion of
Gladys put him at his ease and occupied him so much that he did
not have to speak to her mother.&nbsp; When first the fire was
lighted Mary Malpas would move about the house on her own
business.&nbsp; Abner would hear her talking softly to Morgan in
the scullery while Gladys chattered to him in the flickering
light that filled the room with moving shadows.&nbsp; Later, like
a shadow herself, Mary would return with the boy and settle
herself softly in the chair on the other side of the fire.&nbsp;
Morgan would struggle up on to her knee and cuddle into his
mother&rsquo;s breast, and Gladys, not to be outdone, would climb
on Abner&rsquo;s knee and beg him to tell her stories.&nbsp; He
knew no stories for children, for he had never had a mother to
tell them to him, but he would talk to her about Mawne and the
blind pit-ponies, about the rabbits that lived in Dovehouse
fields, about Tiger and the excitements of the wakes with their
galloping horses and soaring swing-boats.&nbsp; Gladys had never
seen a fair and these descriptions fired her imagination
most.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why ain&rsquo;t there no swing-boats here,
mother?&rsquo; she would ask.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because there aren&rsquo;t enough children to go up in
them.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see them some day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner&rsquo;ll take me to see his; won&rsquo;t you,
Abner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time of the evening, Morgan, curled up on his
mother&rsquo;s lap, was usually as sleepy as Spider who lay like
a hedgehog on the hearth between them.&nbsp; Mary sat there
hugging the child in her arms and never speaking for fear that
she might disturb him, and <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>Gladys, impressed by the silence of
the firelit room, would snuggle closer to Abner and talk to him
in whispers that her mother could not hear.&nbsp; They sat on
either side of the fire in these strangely divided camps, and
Abner would become aware of the beauty and placidity of this
silent woman sitting still in the gloom with firelight playing in
her hair, listening all the time though she did not move, unless
it were to touch with her lips the forehead of her sleeping
child.&nbsp; He used to watch her and wonder what she was
thinking.&nbsp; He could not help watching her as she sat like a
statue staring at the fire.&nbsp; When she turned her eyes
towards him he would look away.&nbsp; He became so used to her
silent company that he could not have been happy without it.</p>
<p>The days shortened, the pollard elms turned gold and the rusty
chestnut leaves in the avenue fell of their own heaviness.&nbsp;
The drowsiness of summer had passed and a new restlessness seized
him.&nbsp; He could not be contented with this peaceful static
existence into which he found himself sinking.&nbsp; The silence
of Mary Malpas lay on him like a heavy spell.&nbsp; He had rested
enough and could no longer be contented to drowse before the fire
with a child in his arms.&nbsp; The peace of Wolfpits could tempt
him no longer when the chill autumn air stimulated him to action
and the natural violence of youth.&nbsp; He felt that what he
wanted was the society of men and the pursuits of manliness.</p>
<p>Once or twice he walked down to Chapel Green in the evening
and drank a pint with the labourers who gathered in the Buffalo
under the eye of old Mrs Malpas, but he found that he
couldn&rsquo;t get on with her.&nbsp; She was always restrained
and severe, giving him the impression that she had taken a
dislike to him from the first, and when she talked to him he felt
that she was trying in her own superior way to find out exactly
what her daughter-in-law was doing at Wolfpits.&nbsp; Even her
questions about the children seemed to him to be dictated by
malevolent curiosity rather than by affection.&nbsp; He felt that
he was like a child in her hands and that she could get what she
liked out of him.&nbsp; When he went to the Buffalo he had
expected to find the cloggers <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>there, but they did little more than
sleep in that dismal house, going for their pleasures to the
relative gaiety and light of the Pound House, where they could do
as they liked.&nbsp; With the labourers at the Buffalo Abner had
nothing in common.&nbsp; He understood nothing of their talk of
crops and beasts and weather even when he could penetrate the
meaning of their speech.&nbsp; He gave the Buffalo up as a bad
job and went to the Pound House himself.</p>
<p>He used to go along there with George Malpas as soon as the
whistle signalled that the day&rsquo;s work was at an end, and
there, in a brighter light and in the stir of a roaring business
he found an atmosphere more suited to his restless spirit.&nbsp;
Sometimes he sat with George Malpas; but George was a gloomy
drinker and better company when he was sober, so more often he
took his seat next to Gunner Eve, who drank nothing but spirits,
and sometimes, under their influence, would talk to him of his
old days of service in the navy, of blue Pacific havens,
palm-huts with brown women, or sometimes of that savage African
river on which he had lost his eye.&nbsp; That was the kind of
life that Abner wanted.&nbsp; In the Gunner&rsquo;s stories a
vista of adventure opened before him.&nbsp; The liquor made him
think that such was the only life for a man.&nbsp; The
foreman&rsquo;s tales of amorous adventure enthralled him.&nbsp;
Therein lay the proper use of women.</p>
<p>There was only one woman in the Pound House: Susie Hind, the
fine, strapping girl whose presence had disturbed him on his
first visit to the inn with George.&nbsp; Mrs Malpas&rsquo;s
hints had led him to believe that she was an old flame of
George&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He found himself comparing her with
George&rsquo;s wife and thinking of the silence and remoteness of
Mary he felt it was easy to understand why George had been led
away.&nbsp; The freedom of Susie&rsquo;s manners had suggested
that she was attainable.&nbsp; Abner, listening to the
gunner&rsquo;s adventures, brooded on this, and the more he did
so the more desirable Susie became.&nbsp; There seemed to him no
reason why he should not possess her.&nbsp; Every night he sat in
the Pound House looking at her.&nbsp; He drank more than he need
have done simply <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>in order that he might remain in her presence.&nbsp;
This inflamed his imagination and magnified in his eyes the
physical elegance which she regarded as necessary to her calling,
but he hardly dared to speak to her openly in this concourse of
men, and when she came near him with her bold but beautiful eyes,
his heart beat wildly and he could say nothing.&nbsp; He usually
stayed in the alehouse till closing time and walked back to
Wolfpits through the haunted night arm-in-arm with George Malpas
who was by this time a little sentimental.&nbsp; In one of these
walks he asked George about his relations with Susie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all right, you can take my word for
that,&rsquo; said George with a laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yo&rsquo;ve seen a good bit of her,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All I want to,&rsquo; George replied, with a wink that
was invisible in the darkness.</p>
<p>Abner was silent and he continued: &lsquo;You&rsquo;d best go
easy for a bit, though.&nbsp; For the time being she&rsquo;s took
up with that devil Badger.&nbsp; But that won&rsquo;t last.&nbsp;
I know our Susie, bless her heart!&nbsp; Susie has her
fancies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner knew already that there was something between Susie Hind
and Badger.&nbsp; He had watched their whispers jealously often
enough.&nbsp; Now he began to examine their intimacies more
closely.&nbsp; The general unpopularity of Badger&rsquo;s
occupation only helped to increase his jealousy.&nbsp; When he
saw their hands meet over the counter he felt that the natural
thing to do would be to rise from his seat, take Badger by the
neck and throw him out of the bar.&nbsp; He measured the thickset
keeper with a fighter&rsquo;s eye, and felt confident that he was
a match for him.&nbsp; Meanwhile he must bide his time.</p>
<p>Every night he went regularly to the Pound House and sat there
waiting for his opportunity, never doubting but that he would get
her when the time came.&nbsp; By the mere habit of his presence a
sort of relationship was established between them, for
Abner&rsquo;s strength and his fairness pleased her, and she
would sometimes pause for a moment in her business, standing
close to him with a tray under her arm and one hand <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>on her
hip.&nbsp; The Gunner used to chaff her as she stood there.&nbsp;
He had done enough lovemaking in his young days and now his only
attitude towards women was one of jovial cynicism.&nbsp; No doubt
the foreman thought that Susie stayed because she enjoyed his
teasing; but Abner knew better.&nbsp; He knew it was himself, not
Eve, that Susie was watching.&nbsp; Between them, unseen by the
other, the air was charged with potential passion like the sky of
a hot night, placid and slumberous yet ready to burst into
lightning.&nbsp; He could laugh at Gunner Eve, this dry old man
who vainly imagined that he was pleasing her fancy.&nbsp; She
smiled at Eve, but all the time her smouldering eyes were fixed
on Abner, and he knew that she heard nothing.&nbsp; Then Badger
would come in and handle her as if he were her master.&nbsp;
Abner did not even mind this, for he saw that she was beginning
to treat the keeper as a habit and her eyes did not caress him
secretly.&nbsp; He began to feel that he could afford to despise
Badger, but he hated him none the less.</p>
<p>In those days he saw little of George Malpas at the Pound
House.&nbsp; Soon after Abner began to visit Mainstone regularly
George had transferred his custom to an inn in Lesswardine.&nbsp;
Abner did not ask him why he had done this, for to have done so
might easily have compromised their friendship.&nbsp; If George
preferred to spend his evenings away from his lodger&rsquo;s
eyes, well and good.&nbsp; On the other hand he did renew his
travelling acquaintance with Mick Connor, who remained one of the
best customers of the Pound House.&nbsp; Mick had always been a
generous drinker.&nbsp; When he was in low water he was not
ashamed of sponging on his pals, but in these days he seemed
never to be short of money, and this, together with the glibness
of his tongue, made him a popular figure in the alehouse.&nbsp;
Abner wondered where the money came from, for Mick&rsquo;s wages
were the same as his own, and though he knew that the Irishman
was a born gambler he could scarcely believe in the permanence of
his friend&rsquo;s luck.</p>
<p>Quite by chance he discovered the source of Mick&rsquo;s
income.&nbsp; One Sunday morning he had walked down to the Pound
House followed by the dog Spider when <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>Mick fell in with him by the
way.&nbsp; He surveyed Spider with a professional eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a likely lookin&rsquo; dog,&rsquo; said
Mick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, she&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me a bitch every time for hunt&rsquo;n . . .&nbsp;
Ah, ye divil, get away wud you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Spider had suddenly become wildly interested in the
Irishman&rsquo;s person and was jumping up and smelling at the
tails of his coat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a wise dog,&rsquo; said Mick.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;d be glad of a dog the like of that on a moonlight
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner had guessed what he meant, but Mick, who could never
resist the chance of producing a sensation, opened his coat and
showed him the contents of a game pocket that he had constructed
by making a slit in the lining.&nbsp; It was a fine
cock-pheasant, splendid in its chestnut autumn plumage.&nbsp;
Mick displayed it sentimentally.&nbsp; &lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that
make your teeth water?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;God, you
could ate it in your hand the way it is!&nbsp; And that bird do
be worth a good half-crown in Craven Arms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where d&rsquo;you get him?&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask Mr bloody Badger,&rsquo; Mick replied with a
wink.</p>
<p>Abner pressed him, and he went on to explain that he and Curly
Atwell and one or two others had developed a plan of poaching on
a commercial scale.&nbsp; A man named Harford, a rabbit merchant
in Craven Arms, the railway junction and cattle-market over the
hills, had arranged to deal with their produce.&nbsp; Naturally,
in such a dangerous business, he bought cheap and sold dear; but
the proceeds of their sport were enough to keep the whole gang in
unlimited liquor, the thing that they needed most.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the only way to keep clear of the buttermilk
cure,&rsquo; said Mick, &lsquo;the way they pay us in this cursed
hole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He ended by pressing Abner to join them, pointing out that
Spider would be a useful ally, and Abner, without any hesitation,
accepted.&nbsp; He was glad of anything with a spice of adventure
in it to give vent to his energies.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t care
much about the money <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>even though he remembered that he
had not yet been able to send Alice her two pounds, but it
pleased him to think that this was another way of getting even
with Badger, a feeling in which Mick, with no more definite
reason than an instinctive hatred of gamekeepers, concurred.</p>
<p>In this way there began a series of midnight adventures that
were a great joy to Abner and an even greater to George&rsquo;s
dog, who asked nothing better in her sport than the help of human
allies.&nbsp; On these nights of misty moonlight the secret
beauty of the country-side smote on Abner&rsquo;s heart though he
knew nothing of it but that he was happy.&nbsp; In the daytime
the land was dead and nothing lived in it but he and his fellow
men, but when evening came the hills, the woodlands, the rivers
and the upland wastes of heather tingled with life.&nbsp;
Something secret and timid that sunlight numbed into a protective
sleep, now stirred and wakened.&nbsp; The voices of the rivers
changed; they were no longer only torrents of swift water but
living things.&nbsp; Trees that in day were silent awoke and
whispered in the night.&nbsp; Amid miracles of nocturnal beauty
Abner walked unseeing.&nbsp; He only knew that he lived more
fully, more intensely in the night.</p>
<p>His senses quickened.&nbsp; His eyes were like the sharp eyes
of a hunting owl so that he felt that in daylight he had been
blind.&nbsp; His ears were tuned to an exquisite degree of
sensitiveness.&nbsp; The cracking of a twig, a distant step on
leaves, the least tremor of a growing tree, sent a shock of alert
pleasure into his brain.&nbsp; And the impalpable cool mist of
autumn sharpened his scent to a keenness that delighted
him.&nbsp; This state of acute sensitiveness was the basis on
which the more than physical thrill of imminent danger was
imposed.&nbsp; The labourers who worked on the farms of Squire
Delahay&rsquo;s estate were naturally in league with Badger
against the depredations of these foreigners.&nbsp; Each of them
was himself a poacher in a quiet way; but they poached for the
pot rather than for the market and felt that the presence of Mick
and his gang was a menace to their privileges.&nbsp; These men,
if less intelligent, were as skilled in woodcraft as the Irishman
himself, <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>and Mick&rsquo;s friends followed their craft in a
constant peril of discovery.</p>
<p>It was a profitable adventure.&nbsp; Abner soon found that his
wages were trebled.&nbsp; Grouse from the mountains, pheasants
from the spinneys, partridges from the stubbles, all found their
way into Mick Connor&rsquo;s bag and were driven in a
ragman&rsquo;s cart to Craven Arms.&nbsp; Mick was content to
leave the rabbits to the labourers who spied upon him.&nbsp; He
spent his money wildly.&nbsp; It even pleased him to treat Badger
to drinks in the Pound House bar, knowing very well that the
keeper guessed where the money came from.</p>
<p>In November salmon began to run up the Barbel to meet the
winter floods, and Mick Connor was more than ever in his element,
remembering desperate days upon the Barrow when he was a
boy.&nbsp; Salmon spearing was to Abner the most exciting pastime
of all: the stealthy approach to the riverside up to his knees in
the ditches of the water-meadows: the milky whiteness of November
fogs; the nearing clamour of the river roaring whitely over
stickles into the salmon pool where it lay dumb and black: Mick
Connor&rsquo;s hoarse whispers, the lumbering shadow of Curly
Atwell, and, in the darkness, the swirl of an eddy black as
ink.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ready . . .&rsquo; Mick would whisper, and suddenly a
flare of light, reddening faces, casting grotesque shadows,
lighting the yellow tree-tops, making a beacon for miles of
dreamy country, as though the forest were aflame.&nbsp; The night
sounds vanished from Abner&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp; The woods held
their breath and listened.&nbsp; He could hear nothing of the
river&rsquo;s tumult&mdash;only the harsh breathing of Atwell and
the hiss of the colza flare.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the houly!&nbsp; Look at him!&nbsp; Fourteen pounds
if he&rsquo;s an ounce!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shadow of a lifted arm against the light.&nbsp; A violent
descent, and then a swirl in the black water and the great fish
struggling on the bank.&nbsp; For Mick Connor never missed his
mark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out with the light!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then a sudden
darkness in which the roar of the stickle and the vague noises of
the trees returned.</p>
<p>This curious insulation, the way in which light blinded <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>their
pickets of alarm, was the great danger of salmon-spearing.&nbsp;
The glare in the tree-tops would always give them away if Badger
and his men were on the watch; and one frosty, owl-haunted night
in the middle of November they had a narrow shave.&nbsp; Mick
Connor was leaning over the bank with lifted spear when Abner
heard the breaking of a stick.&nbsp; A man cursed as he
floundered in a ditch not twenty yards away.&nbsp; Abner, who
doubted the quickness of Atwell, smothered the flare with his
hands.&nbsp; It scorched the horny skin of his palms, but it gave
the signal of alarm.&nbsp; On that side of the pool the current
had undercut the marly bank so that the poachers could not be
seen, but Abner&rsquo;s ears recognised the sound of
Badger&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; The keeper&rsquo;s party ran towards
the bank.&nbsp; A single man, the foremost, leapt down beside
them, shouting that he had got them.&nbsp; Abner let out from the
shoulder in the dark.&nbsp; His fist met the flesh of a
man&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The man gave a cry.&nbsp; For all he knew
it might have been the face of Curly Atwell, but it gave him a
good feeling in the dark, for he felt instinctively that it was
Badger&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They left their spear on the bank, plunging
into the swift stickle above the pool, and found refuge in a
wood.&nbsp; Some one fired after them.&nbsp; He fired low, and
the twigs snapped about them.&nbsp; Abner plunged on through the
wood.&nbsp; He knew that he was running for his life.&nbsp; It
was good to be running for his life.&nbsp; He went on crashing
through the undergrowth of the wood battling with back-springing
saplings, torn with briers, laughing, curiously, wildly
exultant.&nbsp; He did not stop to think that he had lost touch
with the others.&nbsp; In an affair of this kind each must look
to himself.&nbsp; He only knew that he had escaped out of the
mouth of danger.&nbsp; His head spun with the elation of his
heart pumping blood into his brain.&nbsp; In that moment he felt
that he had courage for anything, and it pleased him particularly
to think that Badger had suffered this defeat.</p>
<p>He emerged from the woods into open fields, so calm under the
peace of night that it was hard to believe that any human
violence had lately invaded them.&nbsp; Westward the quiet hills
stood folded for the night.&nbsp; A gibbous <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>moon rose
languidly above the mists.&nbsp; He stood in the middle of the
field, tingling to his finger-tips.&nbsp; He forgot that his legs
were sodden with muddy water, so splendidly his body
glowed.&nbsp; It was ridiculous to think of crossing the hills to
Wolfpits, for it was no more than nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; This
was not a time for sleep but for living.&nbsp; He turned his
steps in the direction of the Pound House.</p>
<p>Just before closing time he reached it.&nbsp; One end of the
bar was full of cloggers, to whom Wigan Joe was reeling off
Lancashire stories.&nbsp; The other was unusually empty, for the
Gunner and most of his company had left the house for want,
perhaps, of Mick Connor, who was their principal
entertainer.&nbsp; Susie stood behind the counter at the deserted
end of the bar swilling dirty glasses, wiping them one after
another, and listening all the time to the clogger&rsquo;s
stories, many of which she had heard before the same evening,
since Wigan Joe had a way of running through his repertoire and
beginning again like an automatic musical-box when the liquor was
in him.&nbsp; As Abner entered the bar Mr Hind appeared in the
door of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; up, Susie,&rsquo; he said with a
jerk of his head in the direction of the staircase.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Two minutes to go, and then lock up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said, &lsquo;All right, dad,&rsquo; carelessly, never
looking at him, for her eyes were on Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Night,
all!&rsquo; Mr Hind muttered as he disappeared.</p>
<p>Abner went straight up to her.&nbsp; The mood of physical
triumph and elation was still on him, and she must have known
that there was something strange about him since, for the first
time, she lowered her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want a word with you, Susie,&rsquo; he said,
addressing her thus for the first time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Best hurry up, then,&rsquo; she said, smiling.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s only two minutes afore we close.&nbsp; What are
you taking?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give us a double gin,&rsquo; he said, and while she
poured the limpid spirit into a clean glass he asked her what she
was doing on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t answer him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look what good
measure I&rsquo;ve given you,&rsquo; she said, handing him his
glass.</p>
<p>He put the drink down on the counter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>goin&rsquo; to put me off like
that,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; She murmured something about Mr
Badger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn you and your Badgers,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What about to-night, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be soft!&nbsp; Look at the time.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s just on ten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get on with you!&nbsp; The time don&rsquo;t
matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of
course I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Father&rsquo;s gone
upstairs.&rsquo;&nbsp; The clock struck ten.&nbsp; Susie called,
&lsquo;Time, please!&rsquo; and the cloggers rose to go in the
middle of one of Wigan Joe&rsquo;s most complicated
stories.&nbsp; They moved toward the door in a bunch, bidding
good-night to Susie, who stood waiting with the key in her
hand.&nbsp; Abner stayed by the bar finishing his gin.&nbsp; The
last good-nights echoed down the street.&nbsp; Susie stood at the
open door waiting for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on, do!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
after time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I stay here?&rsquo; he said, with a
laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know as well as I do why,&rsquo; she said, with a
managing air.&nbsp; &lsquo;That new policeman, Bastard&rsquo;s
got eyes like a weasel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, of course that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He came to the door and quickly closed it, then took her in
his arms and kissed her.&nbsp; She returned his kisses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave go of me now,&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Go out in the lane while I lock up and then come round to
the back door, but don&rsquo;t make too much row about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yo&rsquo;m not codding me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She closed the door after him, saying &lsquo;good-night&rsquo;
in a clear voice for the benefit of the problematical
constable.&nbsp; He heard her lock the door and slip an iron bar
across into its sockets.&nbsp; The lighted windows went
black.&nbsp; He slipped round to the back of the house and stood
waiting in the angle that it made with an outhouse where dry
bracken was stored.&nbsp; For a long time, as it seemed, he stood
there staring at the faint and frosty stars.&nbsp; Then the door
opened softly.&nbsp; She did not speak, but he stole on tiptoe to
the door and entered the kitchen.&nbsp; Inside it was quite dark,
for the shutters were closed and the fire banked down.&nbsp; He
could not <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>see her, being only conscious of her warm and fragrant
presence.&nbsp; He groped in the dark, suddenly finding her face
on his own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My . . . how cold you are!&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Half an hour later she let him out into the yard, with more
tender whispers of farewell and warnings that her father slept
lightly.&nbsp; For a few minutes he stood away from the moonlight
in the shadow of the house, bewildered, stunned.&nbsp; He saw the
white road stretching in the direction of Chapel Green and
Wolfpits, but it meant no more to him than if it had led to the
world&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; He was no longer a part of the
world.&nbsp; He towered above it supreme and isolated in the
flame of his own throbbing exaltation.&nbsp; He had no need of
friends or houses or rest, no memory of the past, no thought for
the future.&nbsp; He stood there self-sufficient and
unassailable.</p>
<p>A little later he became aware of the fact that his feet were
carrying him automatically over the moon-lit road toward the
hills, but he was almost unconscious of his progress, and it
filled him with a sort of mild surprise when he saw familiar
landmarks of the road loom up before him, grow clear, and fall
away behind.&nbsp; His footsteps rang upon the iron road as
though he were shod with steel.&nbsp; From the brow of the hill
above Wolfpits he saw the basin of the Folly Brook brimmed with
mist.&nbsp; The gables of the house rose up into the moonlight,
the hills stood black behind.&nbsp; Under the heavy chestnuts of
the avenue it was almost dark; the water in the ruts had frozen
to a thin crust so that the surface was curiously splashed with
moonlight and with ice.&nbsp; Fifty yards in front of him he saw
a figure moving with lurches from side to side of the lane.&nbsp;
At first he thought it was a stray bullock, but there was
something human in its movements and so he leapt to the
conclusion that it was old man Drew rolling home drunk with sweet
turnip from the cottage of some friend.&nbsp; The figure leaned
for a moment against a stone wall, and Abner, coming abreast of
it, saw that the drunken man was George Malpas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallo, George, what&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; he called.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God, Abner, is that you?&rsquo; George murmured
thickly.&nbsp; <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t half got a drop, I
haven&rsquo;t!&rsquo;&nbsp; The situation amused George so much
that he shook with weak laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on, then, old son!&rsquo; said Abner, taking him
by the arm.&nbsp; Strong as he was he found it difficult to steer
a straight course.&nbsp; George, having once submitted to the
direction of another will, now became somnolent.&nbsp; Abner
almost had to carry him up the garden path.</p>
<p>A light burned in the kitchen, and on the doorstep Mary stood
waiting for them.&nbsp; She looked very frail and beautiful in
the light of candles.&nbsp; From the first her eyes had taken in
the situation, and she offered no spoken comment on it though her
mouth showed that she was suffering the shame of the
situation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me a hand upstairs with him, please,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>The excuses that Abner was ready to offer for his friend died
on his lips.&nbsp; Between them they directed the steps of George
upstairs.&nbsp; When he reached the bedroom he stared about him
as though he had never been there before, and then, giving the
problem up, lurched over on to the bed covering his head with his
hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d best get his boots off,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>He took the right and Mary the left.&nbsp; It was a strange
thing how they had to wrestle with the leather laces and how
tightly the boots stuck to his inanimate feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now he&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Abner, when the
job was finished.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll come up like a daisy
in the morning, never fear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not reply to him but stood with the candlestick in her
hand staring at her husband&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you come downstairs with me, please?&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Abner had not bargained for this.&nbsp; He could not think
what she wanted of him, but he could not very well refuse her,
and so he followed her down the creaking stairs into the
kitchen.&nbsp; She put the candle on the table and faced him
silently from the other side.&nbsp; Then she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me all about it, please . . .
everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing to tell her.&nbsp; He said that he had found
George leaning up against a wall in the avenue and helped him
over the last lap.</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>&lsquo;Were you at the Pound House to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I looked in just on closing time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;m sure that you know.&nbsp; Please tell
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you . . . not if you was at the
Pound House.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where he gets it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you know more about it nor me then,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me like that!&nbsp; I know . . .
I&rsquo;m not a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good talkin&rsquo; like that.&nbsp; A
chap must take a drop in and out.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s human
nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t the drink!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t go to that place only for the
drink.&nbsp; I should have thought you being with him would keep
him straight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking
about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you do,&rsquo; she said, striking the table with
her clenched fist.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know . . . you know. . .
.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s that woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know naught of George&rsquo;s
women,&rsquo; said Abner obstinately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ve no eyes,&rsquo; she said, with a
gesture of scorn.&nbsp; &lsquo;The woman at the Pound
House!&rsquo;&nbsp; She blazed with a white anger: &lsquo;That
dark-eyed devil that&rsquo;s been after him these months, that
Susie Hind . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, her . . .&rsquo; said Abner, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you put me off!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t put me off!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not for me,
it&rsquo;s for his children.&nbsp; You see, I know, so
you&rsquo;d best tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can tell you one thing,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;George ain&rsquo;t been with Susie Hind
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She clenched her hands furiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
only telling me lies . . . lies.&nbsp; How do you know?&nbsp; How
do you know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do I know?&nbsp; I like that!&nbsp; I know because
I&rsquo;ve been with her myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He thought it was a fine and brutal thing to say.&nbsp; With
the same words he had rescued his friend from an awkward
suspicion and proclaimed the thing that he had been wanting to
shout to the stars on his way home.&nbsp; He had been burning to
share his triumph with some one.&nbsp; George would have heard it
if he hadn&rsquo;t been so <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>drunk.&nbsp; Now it was out; he had
got it off his chest; he stood there smiling and triumphant,
wondering what she could say next.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you needn&rsquo;t vex yourself about poor old
George,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>For a second she stared at him.&nbsp; The white anger died out
of her face.&nbsp; She became suddenly red.&nbsp; Her clenched
fingers opened and she clutched at the table.&nbsp; Then she gave
a sudden, choking gasp, and spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You . . .&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you . . . !&nbsp; Oh,
I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it of you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up with you now?&rsquo; he said,
good-humouredly.&nbsp; Her body was shaken with a fit of sobbing
and she left him staring in the candlelight.</p>
<h2><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>The
Thirteenth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning when Abner came
downstairs in the dark he found George making himself a cup of
tea in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you, Abner?&rsquo; he said, turning his neck
gingerly as though it hurt his head to speak.&nbsp;
&lsquo;God!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s lifting the top of my skull
off!&nbsp; This dose&rsquo;ll last me for a bit.&nbsp; Mind you,
I wasn&rsquo;t so boozed I can&rsquo;t remember what
happened.&nbsp; I should have slept up against that old wall if
you hadn&rsquo;t come along.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m a good pal,
Abner.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this point his voice gave out.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have a spot of tea?&rsquo; he said in a hoarse
whisper.</p>
<p>As usual they walked down the valley together at dawn.&nbsp;
The fields lay hoary with rime, so that the light of dawn was
like cloudy moonlight.&nbsp; Their heels crunched into the
brittle ice of the wheel-ruts.&nbsp; Before them, on the white
road, ran the wayward pattern of Spider&rsquo;s dancing
feet.&nbsp; Not a bird sang.&nbsp; The cold air gripped their
temples.&nbsp; It was as though winter were closing on the world
and those who dwelt in it like an iron vice.&nbsp; Dawn whitened
beyond Castel Ditches: light without heat&mdash;light reflected
from ice.&nbsp; But the steady walking thawed their limbs and
George was soon asking in a husky voice for details of what had
happened the night before.&nbsp; Something in Mary&rsquo;s
attitude when they woke that morning had struck him as
unusual.&nbsp; He guessed that she had found a new grievance, and
was anxious to know what she had said.&nbsp; He laughed when
Abner told him that she had questioned him on the subject of
Susie: laughed till the cold air choked him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;m all the same, the women,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jealous . . . that&rsquo;s the top and bottom
of them.&nbsp; What did you tell her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Said I hadn&rsquo;t seen you at the Pound
House.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God!&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d been to
Lesswardine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dain&rsquo;t know naught about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the less you know the better, or you&rsquo;ll be
having <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>these women buzz round you like flies.&nbsp; You can
tell our Mary what you like, but you&rsquo;ll need to keep your
eyes skinned with mother.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to bide on the
right side of the old woman or it&rsquo;s all up.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll have it out of you before you know you&rsquo;re
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the lower end of the valley to
which the cloggers had lately transferred their work.&nbsp; The
whole gang were now housed in the Buffalo and the other scattered
cottages of Chapel Green, but a couple of tents were left
standing on the banks of the Folly Brook and the smoke of a
wood-fire went up blue into the air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t make mother out,&rsquo; George
grumbled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here she is with Wigan Joe and the rest of
them in the house: a mint of money for the asking, and she goes
scaring them over to Mainstone with her long face.&nbsp; If I had
the Buffalo I&rsquo;d soon see they spent their money in the
house.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as good as robbing me the way she sends
them away.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t want the money, but I want it
bad enough, God knows!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They parted when they reached the workings.&nbsp; George
whistled to Spider, but the dog only wagged her tail and then
dived into a trench, preferring to stay with Abner.&nbsp; Munn
appeared, rubbing his hands with cold.&nbsp; Abner laughed at
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put your back into it, Joe, and you&rsquo;ll soon feel
right,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>The day&rsquo;s work began.&nbsp; A red sun rose sluggishly,
half frozen.&nbsp; The light glinted on the long line of swinging
picks and the sounds of the work rose cheerily in the thin
air.&nbsp; Very different was this from the subdued activity of
summer.&nbsp; The labourers did not work only for money but
because the exertion sent the blood tingling warm into their
hands and feet.&nbsp; Work was an ecstasy and to Abner a greater
ecstasy than to the rest of them.&nbsp; He thought of Susie and
of the night before.&nbsp; He whistled as he worked for sheer
physical joy, rejoicing in his strength, for now once more, after
months of soft disuse, his body was finding its right expression
and coming splendidly to its own.&nbsp; He stretched his limbs in
the sunlight, recapturing the moments of physical exaltation that
used to come to him when the Mawne <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>United team stepped out on to the
smooth turf of the Albion ground, a company of clean and splendid
athletes.&nbsp; And all the time, beneath the pleasant anodyne of
work, his body glowed with a rich contentment, knowing that in a
few hours night would come and Susie be clinging in his arms
again.</p>
<p>He had no fear that she would forsake him.&nbsp; He felt, in
every fibre of his body that he was a match, and more than a
match for Badger.&nbsp; Having once attained her he knew that he
could keep her; and in this he was not deceived, for Susie,
having looked on him and found that he was good, had taken a
fancy to him and now kept pace with his passion, asking as much
as he could give.&nbsp; Every evening, as was already his custom,
he would go to the Pound House and take his seat beside Gunner
Eve; but now he no longer needed to follow Susie with his eyes,
was no longer tortured with vague jealousies, for when she passed
him he could feel her soften and respond to his presence.&nbsp;
Sometimes, when no one was looking, she would turn her head in
his direction and for a moment their eyes would meet.&nbsp; He
did not care when men spoke to her lightly or placed their hands
upon her arm, for now he knew that she belonged to him and could
be his for the asking.&nbsp; The events of the first night were
repeated many times.&nbsp; Now a single whisper was enough to
ensure that when the alehouse was empty and Mr Hind safely in
bed, the kitchen door would be opened softly and Susie waiting
for him in the warm darkness.&nbsp; It amused Abner to see the
coldness that she now showed toward Badger.&nbsp; The keeper was
puzzled, for all their love-making was secret and nocturnal, and
Susie and Abner never appeared in public together.&nbsp; Badger
knew that for some unknown reason he had lost her, and this made
him more persistent than ever in his attentions, being far too
important in his own estimation to be discarded without good
reason.&nbsp; Abner laughed to see his irritation.&nbsp; He and
Susie laughed together in the night.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
imagine whatever I saw in him,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>At the end of November Susie went away for a week to stay with
her grandparents in Hereford.&nbsp; Without her the Pound House
meant nothing to Abner, and <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>without considering that his absence
might be noticed, he drifted back into his old habit of returning
to Wolfpits in the evening.&nbsp; It was now more than a month
since he had done this, and in the interval he had scarcely
spoken to Mary Malpas.&nbsp; Returning, and expecting to pick up
the threads of the old life exactly as he had left them, he was
surprised to find the atmosphere of Wolfpits curiously
changed.&nbsp; The attitude of Mary herself was cold and
unfriendly.&nbsp; He found it difficult to make headway against
it, for she scarcely spoke to him, and even the children seemed
to have become infected with their mother&rsquo;s distrust.&nbsp;
It was true that they had seen so little of him as almost to have
forgotten him, but it seemed strange that his old favourite,
Gladys, no longer came instinctively to his arms.&nbsp; He could
not accept the change without a protest.&nbsp; One evening,
finding Mary alone, he tackled her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s come over you?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing&rsquo;s come over me.&nbsp; What do you
mean?&rsquo; she replied coldly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yo&rsquo;m different . . . like you was scared of
me.&nbsp; What have I done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know best.&nbsp; You know what you told me . . .
that night,&rsquo; she said, with tight lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with you,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No . . .&nbsp; Nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what&rsquo;s up with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughed uneasily and went into the scullery.&nbsp; Abner
was seized with sudden rage.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t surprise him
that George couldn&rsquo;t get on with her.&nbsp; Mrs Malpas was
right.&nbsp; She was trying to play the lady with him.&nbsp; With
a woman like that it was useless trying to be frank.&nbsp; He
could read suspicion into everything that she did.&nbsp; When
Gladys, who was now regaining her confidence, climbed on to his
knee, she followed the child with anxious eyes as though she
feared that he would corrupt her.&nbsp; He determined to have the
matter out with her, but she never gave him a chance, arranging
carefully that they should never be alone.&nbsp; For this or for
some other obscure reason she always invited her neighbour, Mrs
Mamble, to come in and sit with her in the evening.&nbsp; This
old woman, innocent of the <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>strange relation between them, would
sit in front of the fire talking incessantly of her dead husband
and her distant relatives down Tenbury way.&nbsp; She had a
brother who kept a small shop in a hamlet called Far Forest, and
was never tired of talking of his importance as an elder of the
local Wesleyan synod and the achievements of her nephew James,
whom his father had destined for the ministry.&nbsp; The old
woman tried to entertain them both with these recitals, but Abner
had little patience with her, and tried to forget that she was
there.&nbsp; He sat reading the football news in the last
Sunday&rsquo;s <i>People</i>; but even this could not shut out
the sound of her slow, insistent voice.&nbsp; One night he asked
for pen and paper and wrote a short but laborious note to Alice,
enclosing a postal order for two pounds, which he had bought in
Chapel Green.&nbsp; Mary watched him all the time that he was
writing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yo&rsquo;m curious, bain&rsquo;t yo&rsquo;?&rsquo;
he thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pretending to take no heed of me, but
yo&rsquo;d give your eyes to see what I&rsquo;ve
written.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed she offered to post the letter for him; but he
declined, putting it in his pocket with a laugh.</p>
<p>In the end he found these evenings at Wolfpits so
uncomfortable that he was glad when Mick Connor inveigled him
into a new expedition against Badger&rsquo;s preserves.&nbsp; By
this time the keeper had looked about him and made plans for
defending his master&rsquo;s property, so that the game was
getting more dangerous every day.&nbsp; Badger had made friends
with Constable Bastard, the new policeman, who had been drafted
to Mainstone from Shrewsbury and looked upon poaching with the
uncharitable eye of a townsman.&nbsp; To the great embarrassment
of Mr Hind, who, not unreasonably, lived in terror of the
licensing justices, and had not yet determined in what degree the
new policeman was corruptible, Bastard began to take an interest
in the customers of the Pound House, poking his whiskered face
inside the taproom every evening and taking count of the company
like a shepherd numbering his sheep.&nbsp; Mr Hind&rsquo;s heart
sank when he found that the constable was a teetotaller.&nbsp;
The appearance of Bastard&rsquo;s face in the doorway made him
tremble for his licence, though these visits only <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>meant that
the keeper and the policeman were working together, hoping to
identify the authors of each poaching outrage by establishing
their absence from the Pound House.</p>
<p>The first expedition in which Abner took part during
Susie&rsquo;s visit to Hereford gave them a big haul.&nbsp;
Abner&rsquo;s own share of it was fifteen shillings, and, thus
encouraged, they raided the keeper&rsquo;s preserves on three
nights in succession.&nbsp; The constable, checking the tale of
drinkers at the Pound House, pointed out that Abner, Mick, Curly
Atwell, and another had been absent on each of the nights in
question, and that Mick had celebrated his return by recklessly
standing treat to the whole taproom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That young Fellows,&rsquo; said Bastard,
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s not been nigh the place for more nor a
week.&nbsp; For myself I&rsquo;d say that he looks a quiet chap,
but you never know . . . upon my word you don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The simpler they looks,&rsquo; said Badger
emphatically, &lsquo;the more they wants an eye kept on
them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m pretty near certain I saw him that night
they was arter the salmon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never you fear!&rsquo; said the constable,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on the lot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It never occurred to Badger, whose energies were centred for
the present on one problem, to connect Abner&rsquo;s absence from
the Pound House with Susie&rsquo;s visit to Hereford.&nbsp; He
was an obstinate and not very intelligent man, thick-set in mind
as in body, who had learnt his own craft thoroughly and knew
little else.&nbsp; He had become aware of Susie&rsquo;s coldness
toward him before her departure, but he had not thought to
explain it by her fancying another man.&nbsp; In any case the
matter might wait.&nbsp; He could only do one thing at a time,
and for the present he was too busy with Mick and his friends to
waste good time in dangling round the Pound House.&nbsp; Perhaps
it was only that Susie wanted more fuss made of her.&nbsp; All in
good time . . .</p>
<p>After ten days she returned, and Abner began to visit the
Pound House again.&nbsp; He found her imperious and exacting, she
could not see too much of him.&nbsp; Bastard reported him to
Badger as a regular attendant at the inn.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble about that young
Fellows,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s after other
game.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no game here to speak on but ours,&rsquo;
said Badger stupidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a different kind I mean,&rsquo; said the
constable.&nbsp; &lsquo;That girl of Hind&rsquo;s is looking
after him.&nbsp; Any night of the week if you want to see a
picture you can watch her take him in by the back door when the
old man&rsquo;s asleep upstairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Badger went livid and swore so violently as to shock the
constable&rsquo;s principles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;not a
word of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seeing&rsquo;s believing,&rsquo; said Bastard.&nbsp;
&lsquo;At any rate seeing&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All thought of the poachers vanished from Badger&rsquo;s
single mind.&nbsp; He left the constable in the middle of their
conversation and went straight to the Pound House, where he found
Susie alone, making a petticoat from a pattern that she had
bought in Hereford.&nbsp; She could see by his stormy entrance
that something had upset him and switched on her most
ingratiating manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is a time since I&rsquo;ve seen you, Mr
Badger,&rsquo; she said, laying aside her work.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will
you have something?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t drink; he refused to waste time in
preliminary skirmishing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going to get round me that way,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this about you and that chap
Fellows?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fellows?&rsquo; said Susie.&nbsp; &lsquo;What Fellows
is that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t start that game on me,&rsquo; said
Badger angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen there was something
up with you for the last month.&nbsp; Now I know what it
is.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t go on like that with me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not that kind of man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;m not that kind of girl, Mr Badger,&rsquo;
said Susie.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought better of you, indeed I
did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can drop all that,&rsquo; said Badger, with a
laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can let on you&rsquo;re as innocent as a
lamb, but I know better.&nbsp; Understand that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s what you mean, I can tell you straight
I&rsquo;m not going to listen to your dirty tongue.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not accustomed to be spoke to by my friends like
that.&rsquo;&nbsp; She rose indignantly and would have gone into
the kitchen but he caught hold of her arm.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t deny it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t demean myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; She tried
to wrench away from him, but he would not let her go.&nbsp; The
warmth of her arm on his fingers made him mad.&nbsp; He wanted to
use her roughly.&nbsp; She cried out with pain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;re hurting me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He wanted to hurt her.&nbsp; He only held her tighter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s your father?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father&rsquo;s gone out,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, let me go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone out, is he?&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll have a talk to
him about this when he comes back.&nbsp; Then we&rsquo;ll see . .
.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can tell him all the dirty lies you like,&rsquo;
she said defiantly.</p>
<p>But, in reality, his words had thrown her into a state of
terror.&nbsp; That squat owl-faced father of hers was the one
person on earth whom she dreaded.&nbsp; It came over her suddenly
that somehow or other she must prevent his knowing, for though he
had no objection to his daughter being free with men for the good
of the house, she knew that he was anxious to keep on good terms
with Badger and would be furious to think that she had taken up
with a labouring man.&nbsp; Somehow she must flatter the keeper
out of his intention; but she knew that a sudden change of front
would be a man&oelig;uvre too transparent.&nbsp; It pleased her,
therefore, to give vent to the emotions which she had so far
controlled and to break down in the most natural tears.&nbsp; She
put her handkerchief to her eyes and sobbed violently.</p>
<p>Badger was bewildered by this but still determined.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t get over me that way,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not if I know it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went on sobbing, and the spectacle began to get on his
nerves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can cry your eyes out, my girl, but I&rsquo;m going
to tell your father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that!&rsquo;
she said violently.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can tell him any lie you
like and it won&rsquo;t make no difference to me.&nbsp; What I
can&rsquo;t stand is that you should think it of me . . . that
you should think I&rsquo;d go with a common chap like that.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s cruel, Mr Badger . . . cruel!&nbsp; After the friends
we&rsquo;ve been. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put her hands on his shoulders and looked at <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>him,
pleading.&nbsp; His lust got the better of him and he took her
violently in his arms.&nbsp; She submitted, and he began to
forget his suspicions.&nbsp; She clung to him so that he could
think of nothing but that she was desirable.&nbsp; Then,
cunningly, gradually she became playful and childish, teasing
him, indignant that he should have thought so ill of her.&nbsp;
By the time that he left her she had convinced him that nothing
could spoil their intimacy; but whatever she pretended she could
not shake herself free from the fright he had given her.&nbsp;
She felt that the time would never pass till she could see Abner
and warn him.</p>
<p>It was no easy matter, for when the evening came and she began
her work in the bar, moving among the drinkers with her usual
smiling freedom, Badger was also there following her with hungry
eyes as she went about her work.&nbsp; He sat in a corner,
isolated, for none of the strangers would have anything to do
with him.&nbsp; While serving a tot of gin to Gunner Eve she
contrived to whisper to Abner, begging him to keep away from the
house that night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come to-morrow early, before it&rsquo;s light on your way
to work.&nbsp; Just to please me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke so urgently and with such evident distress that he
obeyed her, and Badger, who had seen her bending over to speak to
Abner, spent a cold night watching the back of the Pound House in
vain.&nbsp; He might well have been better employed, for while he
stood there shivering Mick Connor made free with half a dozen of
his pheasants.</p>
<p>Next morning, in the half light of dawn, which made the cold
kitchen look unspeakably sordid, she received Abner.&nbsp; The
meeting had none of the warm glamour of their nightly
love-making, and her anxiety made him impatient.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the hell do I care for Badger?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, quiet . . . quiet!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t speak so
loud!&rsquo; she implored him.&nbsp; She submitted to his
embraces, but her mind was not with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s up with you,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>His unconcern irritated her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you
understand?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s better to do
without me for a little than to lose me for good.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what would happen if father <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>knew.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;d send me away to Hereford, to grandma&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d do.&nbsp; Only for a week,
Abner.&nbsp; After that, when he&rsquo;s forgotten about it,
things &rsquo;ll be better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her distress was so real and she seemed so little to belong to
him in her present state that he consented not to see her for a
week.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I shan&rsquo;t come a&rsquo;nigh the place,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to sit there
looking at you and nothing after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . . that would be best,&rsquo; she said
gladly.&nbsp; It inflamed him to think that she could take this
complete divorce so calmly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better finish it off,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then she clung to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, no, Abner. . . .&nbsp;
I couldn&rsquo;t bear that!&nbsp; Only a week, my love, only a
week. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>He kept to his side of the bargain, and Badger was relieved to
see him no more at the Pound House, although the suddenness of
Abner&rsquo;s abstention coloured his suspicions.&nbsp; What with
his pheasants and the woman the keeper&rsquo;s life was becoming
too complicated for his intelligence, for Mick profited by
Badger&rsquo;s new devotion to Susie by ravaging his
coverts.&nbsp; In this Abner, who had no other way of killing
time, joined his friend, and on the last night of the week came a
sharp but bloodless encounter in which the keeper was more than
ever certain that he had seen Abner&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; After
this it became fixed in Badger&rsquo;s mind that Abner was his
principal enemy, the man who was obstinately working against him
wherever he went.&nbsp; Somehow or other, he determined, he must
get the better of him.</p>
<p>On the night when Abner returned to the Pound House, Badger
was already there.&nbsp; Mick, as usual after a successful foray,
was spending money freely, and by nine o&rsquo;clock the room was
full of excited men.&nbsp; Abner was ready to drink with the best
of them, for his pockets were full of money and he had not been
inside a pub for a week.&nbsp; To add to this uproarious assembly
in came George Malpas, returning early from his own dark business
in Lesswardine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go easy, boys,&rsquo; he said, as he entered,
&lsquo;that damned copper&rsquo;s outside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Mick Connor had by now gone too far to go easy.&nbsp; The
liquor which in the early stages of intoxication <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>merely
rendered him funny now made him boastful, and the sight of
Badger, glowering in his corner over a hot whisky, provided him
with a subject for his wit.&nbsp; Atwell tried to keep him within
bounds, but Mick, once fairly nourished, could talk the cross off
an ass&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; The laughter with which his sallies at
the keeper&rsquo;s expense were greeted stimulated him.&nbsp; He
plunged into wild excesses of simile, while Badger sat sipping
his whisky, going redder and redder as he listened.&nbsp; He knew
that the whole room was against him; felt that before long he
must do something to assert himself.&nbsp; If he went out into
the road he would only be laughed at, but no man could sit there
listening to Mick Connor without shame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait while I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you,&rsquo; said
Mick.&nbsp; &lsquo;Over in Connemara there used to be an old gent
named Hewish, a proper old sportsman.&nbsp; It was he that
invented that game I&rsquo;ve told you of . . . spider racing,
spiders burning the legs off of them on a hot plate.&nbsp;
Cock-fightin&rsquo; too.&nbsp; And badger-baitin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m after tellin&rsquo; you that&rsquo;s the sport for a
man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A roar of laughter greeted him.&nbsp; &lsquo;And so say all of
us!&rsquo; said Mick insolently, staring into Badger&rsquo;s
corner.&nbsp; Badger pushed aside the table and rose to his
feet.&nbsp; His glass went down with a crash.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Mr Badger!&rsquo; Susie cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gard!&nbsp; The baste&rsquo;s afther turning on
me!&rsquo; cried Mick.&nbsp; &lsquo;All together,
boys!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Badger pushed his way through the crowd to Mick.&nbsp; The
Irishman lowered his head and butted him in the stomach like a
ram.&nbsp; Badger, falling, saw Abner&rsquo;s smiling face and
lashed out at it.&nbsp; The two men went down together, fighting
on the floor.&nbsp; Susie rushed into the kitchen, calling for
her father, and at the same moment the constable ran into the
room.&nbsp; He began to try and pinion Abner, who had Badger on
the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave them alone,&rsquo; cried George Malpas
excitedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Badger hit him first!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
took hold of the policeman&rsquo;s shoulder, and tried to pull
him back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;re doing?&rsquo; Bastard
shouted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Obstructing my duty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But George would not let him go.&nbsp; The policeman left <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Abner and
closed with Malpas.&nbsp; He was the taller, but the older
man.&nbsp; They swayed in each other&rsquo;s arms and then,
tripping on the leg of an overturned chair, went down
together.&nbsp; The policeman was undermost and his head hit the
stone floor with a dull thud.&nbsp; George, who had fallen above
him, freed himself from his arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The b&mdash;&rsquo;s stunned,&rsquo; said Atwell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Serve him right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Hind had appeared on the scene and was bending over the
prostrate policeman.&nbsp; George leaned panting against the
bar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s blood coming from his ears and
nose,&rsquo; Mr Hind said hoarsely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The b&mdash;&rsquo;s stunned,&rsquo; Atwell repeated
stolidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not stunned,&rsquo; said the landlord,
looking up.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time Abner had got the better of the keeper, whom he
held beneath him on the floor.&nbsp; He heard the crash as George
Malpas and Constable Bastard went over amid a hubbub of
voices.&nbsp; Then, with the landlord&rsquo;s words, which Abner
did not hear, fell a sudden silence.&nbsp; He wondered what was
up, released Badger, and pushed forward to the cluster of men
that surrounded the policeman&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; He heard the
word &lsquo;dead&rsquo; passing from one to another.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lock at the blood coming out of his ear,&rsquo; they
said.&nbsp; And there was George Malpas leaning up against the
bar with his hands behind him gripping it, ghastly pale and
panting with his mouth open, and twitching at the corners.&nbsp;
He didn&rsquo;t see Abner or any one else.&nbsp; A curious
inertia had fallen on the group of men about Bastard&rsquo;s
body.&nbsp; They simply stared at it as though it had fallen into
the midst of them from another planet.&nbsp; Mr Hind, by way of
an experiment, lifted the constable&rsquo;s hand and let it fall
again.&nbsp; It fell on the floor with a wooden sound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somebody run to Lesswardine for the doctor,&rsquo; said
Mr Hind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go myself,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Tell &rsquo;im about the
blood, and be&rsquo;s quick as you can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s snowing,&rsquo; some one called.</p>
<p>Abner went hatless to the door.&nbsp; Looking back into the
kitchen he saw the face of Susie.&nbsp; It was white, <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>like a
mask.&nbsp; For the moment it meant nothing to him.&nbsp; They
looked at each other for that fraction of a second
unrecognising.&nbsp; Abner started running toward
Lesswardine.&nbsp; The hard road echoed.&nbsp; The night was
deadly black and snow was falling.</p>
<p>He scarcely noticed the snow.&nbsp; He went on plodding over
the road to Lesswardine without realising, for the time, the
importance of his journey.&nbsp; He felt the snowflakes spatter
his face, his neck, his chest, for in the struggle with Badger
his shirt had been torn open.&nbsp; He was glad he had come to
grips with Badger.&nbsp; He felt he could do what he liked with
the keeper now.&nbsp; The white-faced vision of Susie, till then
unrealised, came back to him out of the darkness.&nbsp; Scared,
she must have been!</p>
<p>In Lesswardine yellow lamps beamed through halos of cold
air.&nbsp; Crossing the bridge he saw that his clothes were as
white as a miller&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The great flakes danced like
moths in the lamplight, they flew into his mouth and melted on
the heat of his tongue.&nbsp; His feet did not echo in these new
streets, for the macadam was felted with an inch of snow.&nbsp;
He had nearly reached his goal.&nbsp; It was senseless to go on
running, panting, and swallowing mouthfuls of snow; but his legs
would not obey these half-formed thoughts and carried him
onwards.</p>
<p>The doctor was smoking his after-supper pipe when Abner
arrived.&nbsp; The Hinds were good patients, and he did not
hesitate to turn out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give me a hand with the
mare,&rsquo; he said, and they went out into the stable to put
to.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s wife had warmed his overcoat and
wrapped a muffler round his neck.&nbsp; He gave Abner a peg of
whisky to keep him warm.&nbsp; When they were clear of the
Lesswardine lights he asked for details of the affair.&nbsp;
&lsquo;By Gad, that&rsquo;s serious,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That means an inquest and a P.M.&rsquo;&nbsp; He thought
to himself: &lsquo;Two guineas,&rsquo; and touched up the mare
with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say Bastard and George Malpas went down
together?&nbsp; He was struggling with George?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;it was me and Badger he was after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s beside the point,&rsquo; said the
doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bad lookout for
Malpas&mdash;and for his mother, poor old lady!&nbsp; A bad
lookout. . . .&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
homicide&mdash;manslaughter.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>The
Fourteenth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time that Abner and the
doctor reached Mainstone, Bastard&rsquo;s body was growing cold,
and the last hope that his unconsciousness was any less than that
of death had vanished.&nbsp; The Pound House was still full of
those who waited for the verdict, a silent, sober company.&nbsp;
Mr Hind, who had not seen the beginning of the struggle, tried
vainly to find out what had happened.&nbsp; All accounts of it
were confused and contradictory, and in any case it mattered
little to the landlord, for he knew that his house was already in
the black books of the police, and felt sure that this
catastrophe would mean the loss of his licence.&nbsp; The doctor
scarcely needed to look at Bastard&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, fractured base,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
must have died at once.&nbsp; An elderly man with brittle
bones.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing to be done, Hind.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll knock up the sergeant when I get back to Lesswardine
and telephone the coroner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have had this happen for nothing,
doctor!&rsquo; moaned Mr Hind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not your
fault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He must have tripped over that chair.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
everybody, including the doctor, stared at the offending piece of
furniture with interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on, Abner,&rsquo; said George Malpas.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good-night, Mr Hind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Hind did not reply.</p>
<p>All through that night the snow fell slowly,
incessantly.&nbsp; The soft, frozen sky drifted downward idly on
the land, and George and Abner had to pick their way back to
Wolfpits blindly in the small hours, guided through the plain by
the presence of ghostly trees and in the Wolfpits valley by the
snow-muffled tumult of the Folly Brook.&nbsp; The hills were
desolate and savage.&nbsp; They lay dead, and the sky covered
them.&nbsp; Wolfpits itself rose before the travellers&rsquo;
eyes sudden and black through the falling snow.&nbsp; There was
no light in any of the windows, for Mary had given them up long
ago <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>and
gone to bed.&nbsp; Wood embers smouldered in the kitchen
grate.&nbsp; George poked them into a blaze.&nbsp; They took off
their snow-plastered coats and sat in front of the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, this is a bloody fine thing!&rsquo; said
George.&nbsp; &lsquo;Old Bastard gone and me a murderer.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve looked for some queer things but never for
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s my fault,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s bound to come out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not going to help me,&rsquo; said George,
with a laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not it!&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
mother I&rsquo;m thinking of.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no luck in our
family.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no good talking about it.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s my last fling, and I&rsquo;d do it again for a
pal.&nbsp; If it hadn&rsquo;t happened to-night, it
wouldn&rsquo;t never have happened at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner could say nothing.&nbsp; Even now he didn&rsquo;t
realise the seriousness of his friend&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just my blasted luck!&rsquo; said George.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Better turn in unless you want to get frozen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went upstairs with his candle, and Abner followed.</p>
<p>When daylight returned the snow had ceased, but the
night&rsquo;s fall had obliterated the track of their returning
feet.&nbsp; Wolfpits had become a black island in the surrounding
whiteness.&nbsp; From the drift upon the doorstep the snow lay
smooth to the tops of the hills which dawn illumined with a rosy
light.&nbsp; Never had the mountains seemed so near to the house,
so beautiful, and so little threatening.</p>
<p>Abner woke early and looked out on this transfigured
world.&nbsp; In all the house no one was astir.&nbsp; Even old
Drew, who worked in all weathers, had not yet emerged from his
snowbound door.&nbsp; George and Mary still slept.&nbsp; It was
very cold, and Abner threw his coat over his bedclothes.&nbsp; It
was no good getting up, for he knew that with so deep a fall
there could be no work on the pipe-track that day.&nbsp; He lay
in bed, smoking, watching the clustered chimneys of Wolfpits
against the sky.&nbsp; The rosy hue faded from the
mountains.&nbsp; The sky cleared to a thin, dazzling blue.&nbsp;
A thread of smoke issued from old Drew&rsquo;s chimney, rising,
straight as a larch, into the clear air.&nbsp; In the room
beneath him, where George and Mary slept, he heard voices.&nbsp;
No doubt George Malpas <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>was telling his wife what had
happened.&nbsp; Sometimes the talk was rapid; sometimes there
were long silences.&nbsp; Abner was thankful that the sad
business of telling Mary had not been left to him.&nbsp; He heard
the children&rsquo;s voices on the stair.&nbsp; The time had come
when he would have to face them all.</p>
<p>They were all in the kitchen when he came downstairs.&nbsp; He
could see from Mary&rsquo;s eyes that she had been crying; she
scarcely dared to look at him lest she should cry again.&nbsp;
George was pretending to be cheerful.&nbsp; He was playing with
the children, telling them how they must make a snow man in the
drive.&nbsp; He said good-morning to Abner as though nothing had
happened overnight, and Abner&rsquo;s heart went out to him for
his courage.&nbsp; Mary did not speak to him, but it seemed to
him that her red eyes were reproachful.&nbsp; He felt that she
probably considered him responsible for the tragedy, was
conscious of his indirect share of guilt, and wished there were
some way in which he could atone for it.&nbsp; He admired the
manly way in which George took his trouble.&nbsp; Indeed he never
felt so wholly friendly to George in his life.</p>
<p>The elders breakfasted in silence, but the children talked
incessantly, being excited by the snow.&nbsp; An overwhelming
impulse to put himself right with Mary made Abner stop her when
she was carrying the breakfast things into the scullery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;George has told you?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s told me.&nbsp; I suppose there&rsquo;s
nothing to be done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naught that I know on,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; And she
left him quickly, for she did not want him to see her crying
again.</p>
<p>George lit his pipe at the fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Funny to hear
them kids,&rsquo; he said, with a half smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;I mind
it just the same once before.&nbsp; It was at Mary&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s funeral when his sister, her Aunt Rachel, brought
her youngsters over from Bromyard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were spared more of these harrowing contrasts, for the
air was warm, and the children, carefully wrapped up by Mary, ran
out to play in the glistening stuff.&nbsp; Mary did not reappear,
and the two men sat on over the fire.&nbsp; Only George spoke
from time to time.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all of a piece with my luck,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon I was born unlucky.&nbsp; One
thing and another. . .&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind as long as it
don&rsquo;t come out what I was after in Lesswardine.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s a decent woman and I wouldn&rsquo;t have her damaged
by it.&nbsp; I wish to God I&rsquo;d stayed like she wanted
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to be waiting for Abner to speak, so that he felt
bound to ask who the woman in Lesswardine was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A young woman, a widow . . .&rsquo; said George.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have her name mentioned if I could help
it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got enough to put up with.&nbsp; Probably I
shan&rsquo;t see her, so I&rsquo;ll give you a note for
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He relapsed into silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;The odds is,&rsquo; he
went on, after a long pause, &lsquo;this is the last time I shall
see Wolfpits at night.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m not sorry for that,
though there&rsquo;s no denying that Mary&rsquo;s been a good
wife to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke more excitedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s one thing:
try as they will, they can&rsquo;t make it murder.&nbsp;
Accidental manslaughter, that&rsquo;s the most they can make of
it.&nbsp; That means a couple of years hard labour.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t tell. . . .&nbsp; It depends on the damned
jury.&nbsp; Only mention the word &ldquo;poaching&rdquo; and the
judges are again&rsquo; you.&nbsp; Yes . . . you can&rsquo;t deny
she&rsquo;s been a good wife, if I hadn&rsquo;t married her too
young.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got mother to thank for that.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;ll happen to her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
too proud for charity, and she&rsquo;d starve herself and the
children rather than take a penny piece from mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She won&rsquo;t want while I&rsquo;m here,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>George looked at him steadily without replying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean you&rsquo;ll stay here and keep the home
together?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you want me to,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a good pal, Abner,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve said that before.&nbsp; And I
wouldn&rsquo;t have her suffer.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something in
what her dad used to say . . . about good blood and that.&nbsp;
If I hadn&rsquo;t took a fancy against her this wouldn&rsquo;t
never have happened.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have the home broke
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll look to that,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is, if she don&rsquo;t turn against me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s handsome face was working, against his <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>will.&nbsp;
He grasped Abner&rsquo;s hand in his.&nbsp; It seemed a natural
gesture.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a proper pal,&rsquo; he said,
and then, in a debauch of self-pity, &lsquo;By God, you&rsquo;re
the only pal I&rsquo;ve got that I can trust!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Morgan came running into the room ahead of Gladys, anxious to
be the bearer of exciting news.&nbsp; He ran straight to his
father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, son?&rsquo; said George.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dad . . . dad. . . .&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a pleeceman
comin&rsquo; up the drive with a bicycle,&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A strange one we don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; Gladys
added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go into the back to your mother,&rsquo; said
George.</p>
<p>The constable from Lesswardine knocked at the door and handed
two summonses to George and Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Inquest at the
Pound House at two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; You understand it&rsquo;s
important.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have a drink of beer before you go?&rsquo; said
George.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; said the constable, becoming
less official.</p>
<p>George went down into the cellar with a jug.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a bad job,&rsquo; said the constable.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A bad job, sure enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner asked him which way he thought it would go.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no saying,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As long as they don&rsquo;t bring it in
&ldquo;murder.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was a fair young man, newly recruited to the force from
some Herefordshire village.&nbsp; The ride in the snow had
freshened his complexion and made him look healthy and jolly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a nasty drift at the bottom of the hill
by the bridge,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;A good six foot of
it!&nbsp; Well, here&rsquo;s luck!&rsquo; he said, as he drank
off George&rsquo;s beer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Luck&rsquo;s the word!&rsquo; said George, &lsquo;and
God knows I need some!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary came into the room with a set face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Warrants
for the inquest,&rsquo; said George.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, is that all?&rsquo; she answered, with relief.</p>
<p>They set off early for the Pound House, fearing that the
driven snow might delay them.&nbsp; George was almost gay, and
Abner wondered at his friend&rsquo;s courage.&nbsp; They avoided
Chapel Green, being anxious not to pass the Buffalo.&nbsp; In
Mainstone a few women came to their <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>doors and stared at them.&nbsp; The
Pound House door was open.&nbsp; A number of jurors had already
arrived.&nbsp; They were mostly farmers or shopkeepers from
Lesswardine and had agreed that the day was a fine one in spite
of the snow and that it was lucky that the tragedy had happened
at a time when they were not busy on their farms.&nbsp; Susie was
nowhere to be seen, but Mr Hind, worried and paler than usual,
was doing an excellent trade in hot whisky and water.&nbsp; He
was sorry, he told them, that there was no lemon in the
house.&nbsp; Indeed he was feverishly anxious to put himself on
good terms with the jurors.</p>
<p>When George and Abner entered an awkward silence fell upon the
company.&nbsp; Several of those who knew Malpas said good-day to
him.&nbsp; The fact that he was greeted by these men who were
shortly to sit in judgment on him encouraged him.&nbsp; He took a
seat on one of the benches in the corner of the room.&nbsp; Abner
went to the bar and asked for a drink.&nbsp; Mr Hind, with hatred
shining in his pale eyes, served him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hope you&rsquo;re all right to-day, Mr Hind,&rsquo;
said Abner friendlily.</p>
<p>The landlord trembled with rage.&nbsp; He pushed Abner&rsquo;s
glass at him, spilling a quarter of the whisky.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
hope I&rsquo;ve seen the last of you,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>The jurymen now congregated in the other corner of the room as
though they realised that it was not fitting that they should mix
with such important figures in the affair as George and his
friend.&nbsp; They talked together in low voices.&nbsp; Abner and
George sat quietly listening, but only instinctive glances in
their direction told them when George&rsquo;s name was
mentioned.&nbsp; At the end of the bar was another door, leading
into the club-room, generally used for the meetings of friendly
societies, in which the inquest would be held.&nbsp; Abner
wondered if the body of Bastard lay inside it; for heavy steps
were heard from time to time through the closed door.&nbsp; At
last the door was opened and the sergeant of police from
Lesswardine appeared in it.</p>
<p>He stood there very erect and official, bending stiffly to
recognise the more important of the group of jurymen.&nbsp; Then
his eyes fell on George and Abner.&nbsp; He <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>beckoned to
them and called them into the second room.&nbsp; Abner had
expected that Bastard&rsquo;s bony carcass would be revealed
lying in state, but instead of this he saw a long deal table with
an arm-chair at the head of it and six other ordinary chairs on
either side.&nbsp; In front of the coroner&rsquo;s seat were
spread a pile of official papers, ink, blotting-paper, and a
selection of equally impossible pens.&nbsp; On the wall above it
hung a trophy, the horns of a North American bison with a boss of
black hair between them, which, in a more savage age might well
have symbolised the official&rsquo;s power of life and death,
but, in fact, represented those that were vested in the master of
the local branch of the Ancient Order of Buffaloes.&nbsp; The
sergeant looked at his watch.&nbsp; It was already past two
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He went out to look down the road to see if
the coroner was in sight.&nbsp; The young constable who had
delivered the warrants earlier in the day was busy placing a copy
of the New Testament in front of each of the jurymen&rsquo;s
seats.&nbsp; When the sergeant&rsquo;s back was turned he winked
at George and Abner.&nbsp; Then he closed the door and left them
alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve summonsed fourteen for the jury,&rsquo;
said George.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve counted &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s three good friends to me: Mr Prosser of The Dyke,
Jones of Pensilva, and Watkins the tailor.&nbsp; The one
I&rsquo;m frightened of is the big chap with the red face.&nbsp;
Williams, his name is.&nbsp; He fell out with mother over a
hogshead of cider five years ago and haven&rsquo;t spoken to me
nor her since.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d be glad enough to see me
swing!&nbsp; Well . . . what&rsquo;s coming&rsquo;s bound to
come.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis no good thinking on it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said no more, but began to beat out the rhythm of a
music-hall song on the floor with the end of his stick, staring
straight in front of him at the bison&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Abner
wished that something would happen.&nbsp; He hated this
mechanical tapping.</p>
<p>A loud voice was heard in the bar and with it the scraping of
feet.&nbsp; The coroner had arrived.&nbsp; The sergeant threw
open the doors with a flourish and Mr Mortimer entered.&nbsp; He
was a big man, with a handsome, rather heavy face, bushy white
eyebrows over pale blue eyes, and a pointed beard in which a
yellow, like that of tobacco stains, was mingled with
white.&nbsp; He walked <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>quickly to the head of the table,
his coat-tails flapping behind.&nbsp; Under his arm he carried a
sheaf of papers that he spread out flat in front of him.&nbsp;
Then he patted the table on either side of them with his hands
and took up a pen.&nbsp; The sergeant stood stiffly at his elbow,
and the jury shuffled into their places.&nbsp; Mr Williams, as by
common consent, planted himself at the coroner&rsquo;s right
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I declare this court open in the King&rsquo;s
name,&rsquo; said Mr Mortimer in a deep, impressive voice.&nbsp;
The sergeant stood as though hypnotised by the formula.&nbsp; The
coroner turned on him suddenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,
sergeant,&rsquo; he boomed, &lsquo;look alive!&nbsp; We
don&rsquo;t want to stay here all day.&nbsp; Get the jury
sworn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He dived once more into his papers, yawned, rubbed his hands,
glanced behind him at the symbolical buffalo, and then suddenly
decided to clean his nails with a pen-knife.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
with Testaments lifted in their right hands, the jurymen, one by
one in different inflections of the border tongue, repeated the
oath which the sergeant administered to them.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>I
swear by Almighty God</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; I swear by
Almighty God.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>That I will well and duly
inquire</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; &lsquo;That I will well and
duly inquire.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was like the chorus that one may
hear any morning of the week outside the windows of a country
board-school.&nbsp; From time to time the coroner looked up
impatiently from his manicure, and the sergeant increased his
pace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Finished?&rsquo; said Mr Mortimer at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; All correct,&rsquo; said the
sergeant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, gentlemen, you must choose a foreman.&nbsp; Only
be quick about it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In point of fact the jury had been waiting for him for more
than an hour, but the question of choosing a foreman did not
detain them for long, since Mrs Malpas&rsquo;s enemy, Williams of
the Pentre, had already virtually chosen himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good . . . very good!&rsquo; said the
coroner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take them to view the body,
sergeant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They filed out behind the policeman, opening their ranks at
the door to admit the doctor from Lesswardine, who apologised for
his lateness and shook hands with the coroner.</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve done the post-mortem?&rsquo; said
the latter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what kept me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And found what you expected?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . . fractured base.&nbsp; I had no doubt about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cheap two-guineas&rsquo; worth.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d
better take your money now to save time.&nbsp; Sign for it
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The doctor pocketed the sovereigns and placed the florin
aside, according to the unwritten law that obtains in such cases,
for the sergeant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sad affair,&rsquo; said the coroner, with a yawn.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good man, Bastard.&nbsp; One of the old sort.&nbsp;
Conscientious.&nbsp; No brains.&nbsp; Ideal policeman.&nbsp; What
the devil are those fellers doing?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve promised to
call for tea at the Delahays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was hoping,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;that
you&rsquo;d come back with me.&nbsp; My wife . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thanks. . .&nbsp; Very kind of you all the
same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t often see you this way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. Not since Condover&rsquo;s suicide.&nbsp; I believe
his son-in-law&rsquo;s mixed up in this affair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s over there in the
corner.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the usual thing, I think.&nbsp; A brawl
in an alehouse.&nbsp; Alcohol.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The coroner nodded his head dolefully.&nbsp; His cellar was
the best in Ludlow.</p>
<p>The jurors returned, and with a final glance at the
buffalo&rsquo;s head, as though he expected it to tell him the
time, Mr Mortimer began business.&nbsp; First the sergeant
identified the body of his subordinate.&nbsp; Standing rigidly at
attention he rattled off the oath at a terrific speed, running
his evidence on to the end of it without a stop.&nbsp; He could
soon show the coroner how to do it.&nbsp; Mr Mortimer never
raised his eyes from his papers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may say, sir . . .&rsquo; began the sergeant
impressively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may say what you like, sergeant, when you&rsquo;re
asked for it,&rsquo; snapped the coroner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant stepped back, full of offended dignity.&nbsp; The
jury were impressed.&nbsp; Mr Mortimer was behaving in accordance
with his reputation.</p>
<p>Other evidence followed rapidly.&nbsp; George and Abner leaned
forward, listening.&nbsp; George with his head in his hands and
his eyes staring out under the arch of his fingers.&nbsp; The
second finger of his right hand still beat <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>out the
rhythm of the music-hall song that was running in the back of his
mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dr Hendrie!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall
give to this court shall be the truth</i>, <i>the whole
truth</i>, <i>and nothing but the truth</i>.&nbsp; Arthur
Cuthbert Hendrie.&nbsp; Thirty-eight.&nbsp; M.R.C.S. and
L.R.C.P.&nbsp; I am a physician and surgeon practising in
Lesswardine.&nbsp; I had seen deceased but did not know
him.&nbsp; Yesterday evening before ten o&rsquo;clock I was
called to the Pound House.&nbsp; I arrived there between ten and
eleven . . . nearer eleven, and found deceased lying on the floor
of the bar with blood and serum flowing from ears and nose.&nbsp;
Both ears.&nbsp; He was quite dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite dead. . . .&nbsp; Can you say how long he had
been dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; Go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I immediately formed the opinion . . . they told me
that he had had a violent fall . . . that death was due to a
fractured base of the skull.&nbsp; There was a bruise over the
left temporal region.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You performed a post-mortem examination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; This morning.&nbsp; I found the fracture
that I had suspected in the middle fossa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will your honour ask&rsquo;n what that there
means?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The witness means the middle part of the base of the
skull.&nbsp; FOSSA,&rsquo; the coroner explained loftily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Death, no doubt, was instantaneous.&nbsp; The condition
was consistent with the story of a violent fall on a stone
floor.&nbsp; The same condition might have been caused by a blunt
instrument.&nbsp; Deceased was old for his years, as shown by the
atheromatous condition of the cerebral arteries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good.&nbsp; Have you any questions to ask the
witness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The jury all shook their heads.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are in a hurry, Dr Hendrie, I think we can spare
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir.&nbsp; Good day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Daniel Prosser Hind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Daniel Prosser Hind, forty-nine, was a licensed <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>victualler
and the lessee of the Pound House.&nbsp; The owners were Messrs
Astill of North Bromwich.&nbsp; He knew the deceased:
couldn&rsquo;t say that they were friends, as deceased had only
lately come to Mainstone.&nbsp; He remembered last night.&nbsp;
The bar was middling full.&nbsp; He himself was in the parlour
working over accounts, his daughter being in charge of the
bar.&nbsp; About nine-thirty he heard a row and ran into the
bar.&nbsp; The first thing he saw was Mr Badger on the floor and
young Fellows on the top of him.&nbsp; Behind them he saw Bastard
lying on his back, with blood coming from his ears and
nose.&nbsp; Some one said Bastard was stunned.&nbsp; He felt
Bastard&rsquo;s heart and said: &lsquo;No, he&rsquo;s
dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did not see deceased fall.&nbsp; He was
told. . . .&nbsp; He quite understood and begged his
worship&rsquo;s pardon.&nbsp; If he might say so, nothing of this
kind had ever occurred in a house under his management
before.&nbsp; What with the cloggers and the navvies it was no
easy matter to keep an orderly house.&nbsp; He wished to express
regret for what had happened.&nbsp; He could not say if Badger
and Fellows had been drinking.&nbsp; Mr Badger was usually a
temperate man.&nbsp; A man named Connor had the appearance of
being the worse for liquor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you not aware of this before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No. As he had explained, he was busy with the October
accounts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You consider your daughter a fit person to be in charge
of a crowded bar?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; His daughter was quite competent and used to
keeping order.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How old is she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was twenty years of age.&nbsp; Messrs Astill, he
persisted, always expected the accounts to be ready by the end of
the month, and he had happened to be a little behind with
them.&nbsp; Messrs Astill would speak for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You consider that you performed your duty as licensee
of this inn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Certainly he considered he had done his duty.&nbsp;
He had sent for the doctor at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You really expect me and the jury to believe that a
girl of twenty is a fit person to be left in charge of a <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>bar full of
those rough men?&nbsp; Very well. . . .&nbsp; You can stand
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Susan Hind, twenty, said she was daughter of the previous
witness.&nbsp; She did not know deceased, though he was in the
habit of looking in of nights.&nbsp; She had never served him in
the bar.&nbsp; On the night in question there was nothing
unusual.&nbsp; There were near about twenty men in the bar.&nbsp;
Mr Badger was sitting alone over in the corner.&nbsp; He was not
drunk.&nbsp; Fellows was not drunk.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t think
that Connor was drunk.&nbsp; She ought to know when a fellow was
drunk!&nbsp; There was no special rule as to when they should be
served or not.&nbsp; Yes, that was it, she used her
discretion.&nbsp; Certainly Connor was excitable.&nbsp; He had
had two or three quarts.&nbsp; No, that was nothing for
Connor.&nbsp; He was always quick with his tongue, and the others
were laughing at him.&nbsp; She agreed with her father that she
could manage men if any one could.&nbsp; She had been used to it
for years . . . ever since she was sixteen.&nbsp; She
hadn&rsquo;t noticed anything until Badger dropped his glass on
the floor and came over to Connor.&nbsp; She supposed Connor had
riled him, but she hadn&rsquo;t been listening.&nbsp; Connor
always went on at people.&nbsp; She saw Badger give Fellows a hit
in the face and then the two of them went down.&nbsp; She called
her father, and while her back was turned Bastard must have come
in.&nbsp; She saw him try to pull Fellows off Badger.&nbsp; She
saw Malpas take Bastard by the arm.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t use no
violence that she saw.&nbsp; Bastard tried to fix Malpas&rsquo;s
arms.&nbsp; She saw the two of them swaying about together.&nbsp;
They must have tripped over something, they went down so
sudden.&nbsp; Bastard did not cry out.&nbsp; She remembered
nothing more, she was that scared.&nbsp; Malpas had not been
drinking.&nbsp; He had had one drink: a small whisky.&nbsp; Of
course she couldn&rsquo;t say if he had got drink anywhere
else.&nbsp; In her opinion he was sober.&nbsp; The only man in
the room that was drunk was Atwell.&nbsp; She had gone on serving
him because she knew by experience that he could behave decent
with it.&nbsp; He was like that most nights.</p>
<p>Atwell, who had smiled at this tribute to his powers, was
called next.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t remember nothing.&nbsp; He <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>couldn&rsquo;t say if he was drunk because he
didn&rsquo;t remember.&nbsp; Asked if he wasn&rsquo;t ashamed of
himself, he had nothing to say.</p>
<p>Michael Connor corroborated the evidence of the witness Susan
Hind.&nbsp; Anything he had said to Badger was not out of the
way.&nbsp; He was only letting on.&nbsp; He admitted having a
drop taken.&nbsp; He was nourished, not drunk.&nbsp; Atwell was
drunk, more luck to him!&nbsp; That was making the court no
impertinent answer.&nbsp; He said it by the way of no harm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner Fellows!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had been sitting half hypnotised by the progress of the
evidence.&nbsp; Each of the witnesses had seemed to him strange
and unfamiliar.&nbsp; This subdued, tight-lipped Susan was not
the girl who came passionately to his arms.&nbsp; Mr Hind was
pale, shabby, shrunken.&nbsp; Even Mick was not the radiant
companion that he knew.&nbsp; He heard his own name in a
dream.&nbsp; George Malpas pushed him forward as the sergeant
took an officious step in his direction.&nbsp; He stood at the
foot of the long table, staring at the top of the coroner&rsquo;s
head and the buffalo horns above it.&nbsp; The foreman of the
jury was examining him closely, much as on market days he would
have examined a likely bullock.&nbsp; The man with the white
beard went on writing in a large, fluent hand, while the sergeant
thrust the Testament into Abner&rsquo;s fingers and dictated the
oath to him.&nbsp; He had to clear his throat, for his voice had
left him.&nbsp; The coroner blotted his notes methodically and
looked up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. . . .&nbsp; Abner Fellows.&nbsp; Age?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Occupation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Labourer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me all you know of what happened last night . . .
not too fast, I have to write it down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Slowly Abner told his own story.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good!&nbsp; You say that Badger hit you in the
face.&nbsp; Are you on bad terms with Badger?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never spoke to him before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When he struck you you lost your temper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any one would.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say Malpas is a friend of yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>&lsquo;I lodge with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Malpas was not drunk?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that I could see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know where Malpas had been that
evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner hesitated.&nbsp; He felt that George&rsquo;s eyes were
on him from behind.&nbsp; &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner went back to his seat.&nbsp; He saw Mr Hind rubbing his
hands together nervously, saw the white face of Susie.&nbsp; He
flopped down heavily into the seat beside George.&nbsp; Malpas
never stirred.&nbsp; He still sat with his hands to his head,
drumming with his finger on his temple.</p>
<p>&lsquo;William Badger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>William Badger, gamekeeper in the employment of Sir George
Delahay, said he had been to the Pound House on business.&nbsp;
His business was to try and pick up information about poaching on
his master&rsquo;s land.&nbsp; Nothing was safe in Lesswardine
since the navvies had been working there.&nbsp; He was watching
three men.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Name them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Connor, Fellows, and Atwell.&nbsp; He believed Connor was the
ringleader.&nbsp; He had not come there to watch Malpas.&nbsp;
Constable Bastard knew that he was there on that business.&nbsp;
He had told Bastard that he thought he had recognised Connor in
an affray three nights before.&nbsp; He had sat in the corner
quietly listening.&nbsp; Connor had been talking &lsquo;at
him&rsquo; all evening, and at last he had lost his temper.&nbsp;
He was a quick-tempered man and couldn&rsquo;t abide
poachers.&nbsp; He had meant to shut Connor&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;
He couldn&rsquo;t say if he had meant to hit him.&nbsp; When he
came up to Connor he saw Fellows looking ugly.&nbsp; They were
all the same gang.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t remember hitting Fellows
in the face, but if he hadn&rsquo;t done so Fellows would have
hit him.&nbsp; The next moment Fellows was on the top of
him.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t see Bastard come in.&nbsp; Bastard was
a friend of his.&nbsp; He did not see Malpas and Bastard
fighting.&nbsp; He could not have seen Bastard fall, as Fellows
was on the top of him.&nbsp; In his opinion Bastard had died in
the performance of his duty.&nbsp; Bastard had been a great help
to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;George Malpas!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>George walked straight to the foot of the table,
haggard, tall, handsome as ever.&nbsp; While he gave his evidence
he still drummed with his fingers on the board.&nbsp; The tone of
Mr Mortimer&rsquo;s voice sharpened as he questioned him, but
George&rsquo;s account of the affair agreed in every detail with
that of the other witnesses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not suggest that you attacked Bastard when under
the influence of drink?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. I had not been drinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where had you spent the earlier part of the
evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At Lesswardine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a public-house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. With a friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you and Bastard on good terms?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had never spoken to him before in my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why did you suddenly attack him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never attacked him.&nbsp; Badger had hit out at
Fellows and Fellows had a right to get his own back.&nbsp; I
wanted to see fair play.&nbsp; I put my hand on Bastard&rsquo;s
arm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, you know.&nbsp; It is a
serious offence to interfere with a constable in the discharge of
his duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fellows was my pal.&nbsp; I never did nothing to
Bastard.&nbsp; When I touched his arm he turned on me.&nbsp; He
was trying to take me in charge.&nbsp; We must have tripped on
something.&nbsp; We fell down together.&nbsp; I had nothing
against Bastard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, you may sit down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant cleared his throat: &lsquo;If I may say a few
words, sir . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>The coroner finished his notes, then sat back to listen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may say, sir, that we have been dissatisfied for some
time with the conduct of this house.&nbsp; Neither Mr Hind nor
his daughter bear a good character with us, and Bastard has had
occasion to speak to me about the goings-on here from time to
time.&nbsp; He has also said that Mr Badger was a great help to
him.&nbsp; Connor, Atwell, and Fellows all have the name of rough
characters.&nbsp; We have only been waiting for the necessary
evidence . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do, sergeant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good, sir.&nbsp; On inquiries in Lesswardine, I
find that Malpas spent the evening in the house of a young widow
woman named . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>George rose to his feet and took a step forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit down!&rsquo; shouted the coroner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Named . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do, sergeant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you wish, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Mortimer adjusted his glasses and sat for a moment in
silence, turning over his paper:.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, gentlemen,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;you have
heard this . . . er . . . very distressing evidence.&nbsp; In
this type of case&mdash;and I am glad to say they are rare in the
district&mdash;it is usual to find a great conflict of
evidence.&nbsp; Here the . . . ah . . testimony is unusually
clear.&nbsp; In the first place you have a public-house.&nbsp; A
public-house which, I am bound to say, appears to me to have been
managed with a considerable degree of laxness.&nbsp; In this part
of the country we . . . ah . . . suffer from the presence of a
floating population, gipsies, cloggers, and at the present moment
the men engaged on the North Bromwich Waterworks.&nbsp; These men
have to spend their evenings somewhere, and it appears that the
Pound House . . . ah . . . found favour with them.&nbsp; They
were in the habit of drinking here every night, sometimes under
the supervision of a girl of twenty.&nbsp; The sergeant has said
that he considers this young woman . . . ah . . . advanced for
her years.&nbsp; That may well be; but none the less I think Hind
has been lacking in responsibility.&nbsp; Very good. . . .&nbsp;
Among the men who frequent this house are three notorious
poachers: Connor, Atwell, and Fellows.&nbsp; Poaching is another
of the pests that this floating population brings in its
train.&nbsp; Badger, the keeper, who gave his evidence very
clearly and straightforwardly, was in the habit of visiting the
Pound House to keep an eye on this . . . ah . . . disorderly
trio.&nbsp; As he had a right to do, he enlisted the help of the
deceased.&nbsp; The affair began in the usual way of a
public-house brawl.&nbsp; What Connor said to Badger; whether
Badger assaulted Fellows: these are matters that do not concern
you.&nbsp; Only, in passing, I say that the whole business could
not have occurred in a properly managed house.&nbsp; There was a
struggle.&nbsp; The deceased constable, in the plain performance
of his duty, entered the bar <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>and . . . ah . . . commenced to
separate Badger and Fellows.&nbsp; If his desire was to protect
Badger, well and good . . . but even that is immaterial.&nbsp;
Now comes the important part.&nbsp; Malpas says that he . . ah .
. . says that he put his hand on the arm of the deceased and that
thereupon Bastard turned on him and tried to take him in
charge.&nbsp; He then, by his own admission, resisted
arrest.&nbsp; He and Bastard struggled together and fell in each
other&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; The medical evidence tells us that
Bastard died from a fractured base of the skull, the result of
this fall.&nbsp; You may ask yourselves the question: &ldquo;Was
Bastard within his rights in arresting, or trying to arrest
Malpas?&rdquo;&nbsp; You need not find an answer to it.&nbsp;
Legally the answer is &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; but all that is expected
of you is to determine how the deceased met his death.&nbsp; He
met his death in a struggle with Malpas.&nbsp; Malpas, by his own
admission, first laid hands on him, thus obstructing an officer
in the performance of his duty.&nbsp; Next, again by his own
admission, he resisted arrest.&nbsp; As a result of this
resistance Bastard fell.&nbsp; As a result of the fall he
fractured his skull and died . . . ah . . .
instantaneously.&nbsp; You may trace, if you like, the
responsibility for his death backward through Connor, Badger, and
Fellows to Hind; but the immediate cause of it was
Malpas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The coroner took off his glasses and pushed his notes
aside.&nbsp; He spoke slowly, waving the pince-nez to mark his
points.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well. . . .&nbsp; Now it is your duty to determine
the degree of Malpas&rsquo;s responsibility.&nbsp; Did Malpas
intend to kill the deceased?&nbsp; The sergeant of the police has
tried, very improperly, to make a statement as to Malpas&rsquo;s
general character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant shuffled his feet and swallowed, but succumbed to
a sense of discipline and was silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am bound to say that there is no evidence pointing to
Malpas having killed Bastard of malice aforethought.&nbsp; There
is no reason to suppose that he lied when he told you that he had
never spoken to Bastard before.&nbsp; Did he, then, desire to
attack Bastard on the spur of the moment with intent to
kill.&nbsp; He has told you that he wanted to see fair play
between Fellows, whom he describes as his &ldquo;pal,&rdquo; and
Badger, and I am inclined <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>to believe him.&nbsp; Another
question presents itself: &ldquo;Did he become murderous under
the influence of drink?&rdquo;&nbsp; This is negatived by all the
evidence.&nbsp; Now you must be careful.&nbsp; If Malpas laid
hands on Bastard with intent to kill, either under the influence
of an old grudge or in a sudden fit of passion, whether drunk or
sober, he is guilty of murder, and it is your duty to say
so.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, he laid hands on Bastard without
intending to offer him any violence, and if, in the course of a
struggle in which he was resisting arrest, he caused Bastard to
fall and thus brought about Bastard&rsquo;s end, his crime lies
on the borderland between murder and homicide . . . ah . . .
manslaughter.&nbsp; If Malpas had no part in the death of the
deceased, you may say that the constable died by
misadventure.&nbsp; I think this is a case in which you may be
left to decide for yourselves.&nbsp; Nothing that you know of
Malpas&rsquo;s private life, and I presume that you all know
something of it, must influence your verdict.&nbsp; The death of
a policeman, a man whom the law provides for your protection and
the protection of your property, is a very serious matter.&nbsp;
If policemen are to be obstructed in their duty with impunity the
whole fabric of life in these remote districts becomes . . . ah .
. insecure.&nbsp; You may now consider your verdict.&nbsp; You
had better retire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Mortimer put on his glasses.&nbsp; The jury, led by
Williams, shuffled out like a group of sidesmen collecting in
church.&nbsp; The sergeant bent over the coroner, whispered and
handed him a paper which he put aside.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
in too great a hurry, sergeant,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; The
witnesses sat motionless in the back of the court: Susie, as
before, staring straight in front of her as pale and tragic as a
young widow; Mr Hind with his hands clasped in front of him,
bunched up like a sack, and his pouched, owl-like eyes paler than
ever, waiting for a rider to the verdict; Badger, obstinate, with
his head thrust forward; Mick and Atwell stolidly masticating
tobacco.&nbsp; Abner saw them all petrified by the gloom of
suspense.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s finger had ceased from its
mechanical tattoo.&nbsp; All through the coroner&rsquo;s summing
up he had listened intensely; once or twice his lips had moved
and his <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>muscles stiffened as though he wanted to say
something.&nbsp; Now he sat quite still with his hands on his
knees, staring, as it seemed, at the buffalo&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>One after another the witnesses were called up to sign their
evidence.&nbsp; The coroner looked at his watch and sighed.&nbsp;
It seemed as if he would not have time to take tea with the
Delahays, and this annoyed him, for Lady Delahay was a very
attractive woman and a visit to Lesswardine Court always left him
with a pleasant afterglow and made him feel that but for his wife
he might have become an ornament of county society.&nbsp; The
sergeant stood like a waxen policeman in Madame
Tussaud&rsquo;s.&nbsp; By a combination of frowns, winks, and
rollings of the eyes, he indicated to his bewildered subordinate
that the Testaments on the table might now be collected.&nbsp;
The young constable stumped round the table on noisy
tiptoes.&nbsp; No other sound was heard but the settling of
thawed snow on the roof, the tinkle of a distant anvil, and the
noise of a blob of nicotined saliva which Atwell privily dropped
upon the floor and then obliterated with a sideways motion of his
foot.</p>
<p>The jury re-entered and took their seats at the table.&nbsp;
The sergeant insensibly stiffened.&nbsp; Mr Williams held a paper
in his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the coroner.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
arrived at your verdict?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, your honour.&nbsp; Unanimous.&nbsp; We find . .
.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait a moment. . . .&nbsp; Yes, very good . . . go
on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We find, unanimous, that the deceased died in
accordance with the doctor&rsquo;s evidence, and that his death
was caused unintentionally by George Malpas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is manslaughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, your honour.&nbsp; Unintentional
manslaughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t qualify it.&nbsp; Manslaughter.&nbsp;
You have added no rider?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, your honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am bound to say I endorse your verdict.&nbsp; I
think that you might profitably have expressed your opinion on
the management of this house.&rsquo;&nbsp; He called
&lsquo;Daniel Hind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Hind rose with a gasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have heard what I think of the management of <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>your house,
and I hope that the licensing justices will . . . ah . . .
endorse it.&nbsp; Another time when an inquest is held in this
room in winter the least you can do is to put a fire in it.&nbsp;
George Malpas!&rsquo;</p>
<p>George staggered to the end of the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have heard the jury&rsquo;s verdict.&nbsp; You will
be committed on my warrant to take your trial on a charge of
manslaughter.&nbsp; You are lucky that the charge is not . . . ah
. . . graver.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant, who had been waiting for this, again presented
his paper to the coroner, and Mr Mortimer, having wiped the nib
of his pen, signed it in his bold, deliberate handwriting.&nbsp;
He signed it carefully and looked at his signature
afterward.&nbsp; It was not often that he tasted so singular a
sensation of power.&nbsp; The sergeant blotted the document and
advanced toward George Malpas.&nbsp; He came like a dignified
spider toward a fly safely entangled in its web.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better go and tell them,&rsquo; George said to
Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell mother first.&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Tell
&rsquo;em I&rsquo;m all right.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>The
Fifteenth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Abner</span> did not wait for George to be
arrested.&nbsp; To the evident scandal of the sergeant he made
straight for the door and slipped into the bar.&nbsp; He closed
the door quietly, and stopped for a moment.&nbsp; There was
something in the feeling of the room that told him he had broken
in on a secret.&nbsp; No doubt the continued strain with which he
had heard the evidence unfolded had tuned his nerves to a
supersensitive pitch: he wasn&rsquo;t usually nervous under any
conditions, but the sudden change from the courtroom to this
cold, empty chamber, unfamiliar in the snow-light, took him
aback, unsteadied him.&nbsp; At the moment of his entrance the
room had been expectant, listening.&nbsp; Now, when he paused for
a second to look at it, he saw nothing unusual, only the long
shelves with their black bottles of dubious port and sherry, the
keg-shaped receptacles of glass in which spirits were kept on
tap, the polished handles of the beer-engine.&nbsp; The only
unusual thing was the closed door of the room behind the counter
in which Bastard&rsquo;s body now lay.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t try
to find an explanation for the peculiar chill that this room gave
him, midway between the dead man&rsquo;s flesh and the anguished
soul of the man who had killed him; but he felt it, and when he
turned the key in the locked door and stepped out into the street
he felt again, behind him, the sense of something strange
stealing back into the bar.&nbsp; He shivered and set off for
Chapel Green to tell Mrs Malpas.</p>
<p>All sparkle of light had vanished from the snow; the sky had
now grown colder than the land, and in the north a wind was
rising.&nbsp; He walked fast to keep the heat in his limbs.&nbsp;
He passed the last cottages of Mainstone and came into the length
of Roman road which he and George had so often travelled at
night.&nbsp; The wind set up a faint and mournful singing in the
telegraph wires.&nbsp; The winter night descended.&nbsp; No human
shape was to be seen on the long white road <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>but that of
Abner and another smaller figure that approached him rapidly from
the west.&nbsp; He took it for granted that this was a little
girl hurrying home to Mainstone from the dissenting school at
Chapel Green, but when they met in the dusk and stared at one
another he suddenly became aware that the wayfarer was
George&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; All the time since he left the inn
he had been turning over in his mind the ways in which he might
best reveal his tragic news.&nbsp; Now that he found himself face
to face with Mrs Malpas, small, intense, and awful in her Sunday
bonnet, he could say nothing.&nbsp; They stared at each other for
a moment in which Abner was conscious of the hatred in her black
eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Evenin&rsquo;, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s lucky I met you.&nbsp; George sent me along
with a message.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me . . . tell me quick, young man,&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t keep it back whatever it
be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bad news, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it is.&nbsp; Tell me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve took him in charge.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
manslaughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made a shrill, wailing noise, something between a laugh
and a cry.&nbsp; She gripped his arm tight.&nbsp; He knew that
she would almost rather have touched any one on earth, but if she
had not steadied herself she would have fallen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Manslaughter. . . .&nbsp; Oh, God, my God!&nbsp; O
Lord, have mercy on him, poor soul, and on us too.&nbsp; To think
it should come to that!&nbsp; Oh, God . . . God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She clutched him again as though a wave were sweeping her legs
from under her.&nbsp; Her bony fingers went into the muscle of
Abner&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t take on, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Manslaughter&rsquo;s a different thing from
murder.&nbsp; Thank your luck for that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of luck!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Luck&rsquo;s a heathen word.&nbsp; As a man sows so shall
he reap.&nbsp; The hand of the Lord is heavy on me and my
son.&nbsp; He hath forsaken the way of righteousness.&nbsp; Drink
and strange women and all the abominations of the ungodly.&nbsp;
All my prayers on him were wasted, young man, for I
couldn&rsquo;t keep his feet in the way.&nbsp; Whom the Lord <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>loveth he
chasteneth.&nbsp; The Lord gave and the Lord hath took away, and
now he stands before an earthly judge.&nbsp; I must go and see
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She detached herself from Abner&rsquo;s arm, but a fit of
trembling took her and made her cling to it again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d best come home along of me,
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll have took
him to Lesswardine by this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She broke down into harsh sobs, crying childishly, and in
between her sobbing he could hear her babble the same curious
mixture of scriptural and unscriptural lamentation.&nbsp; She
talked so wildly that he thought the old woman was going off her
head.&nbsp; When she sobbed the jet ornaments on her bonnet
danced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come home along of me, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he repeated
helplessly.</p>
<p>She seemed not to hear him.&nbsp; &lsquo;George, my little
George . . .&rsquo; she sobbed, abasing, accusing herself before
the harsh personal deity that she imagined, wrestling with him in
prayer and entreaty, &lsquo;Oh, Lord, forgive him . . . forgive
him . . . forgive him!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, quite suddenly, she
stopped.&nbsp; No sound was heard but that of her faint
trembling.&nbsp; Abner thanked goodness that she had tired
herself out, but he was mistaken.&nbsp; Without the least warning
her weak hands pushed him away.&nbsp; She stood before him in the
middle of the road and faced him with her ridiculous bonnet awry
and her fingers clenched like the claws of some small, fierce
wild animal, waiting to spring at a man&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; Her
wrists worked with passion.&nbsp; She forgot all her scripture
and cursed him in her own words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;ve led him astray,&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You . . you!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I know it the
very day when you and your mate came to our house?&nbsp; You, the
scum of the roads!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s fine company for a decent
man!&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t touch pitch and not be defiled!&nbsp;
I begged him and begged him not to have the likes of you in his
house, but he laughed at me.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ve dragged him
down, down . . . as low as a man can be dragged.&nbsp; You with
your drink and your poaching and your women!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
think I haven&rsquo;t heard what happened . . . the two of you
coming home drunk of nights, singing bawdy songs in the
dark.&nbsp; That wasn&rsquo;t enough for you!&nbsp; <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>You must
drag him into your drunken fighting, drag him down and down into
your mucky life.&nbsp; And then you come and talk to me of
luck.&nbsp; Luck!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been led astray, that&rsquo;s
what George has, by your company.&nbsp; If George&rsquo;s soul is
damned, it&rsquo;s you who will suffer for it, bringin&rsquo;
your town ways into a country place.&nbsp; You and his precious
wife!&nbsp; The two of you between you!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s in the
blood comes out in the life.&nbsp; Her father were a thief and a
swindler and a suicide, and God visits the sins of the
fathers.&nbsp; Like father, like daughter!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
sort of bedfellow my George has had, and this is what she&rsquo;s
brought him to, poor lamb!&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you think, young
man, that God don&rsquo;t remember!&nbsp; If you done it to the
least of these you done it unto Me!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think
you can push a young man into hell and not fall into the fire
after him.&nbsp; You and her together. . . .&nbsp; You can trust
God for that!&rsquo;&nbsp; She exhausted her breath and stood
panting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on, missus,&rsquo; said Abner heavily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be perished out here.&rsquo;&nbsp; But when
he clumsily approached her she ran away down the road toward
Mainstone like a mad woman, this pathetic bundle of burning
hatred in her Sunday clothes, and left him foolishly
standing.</p>
<p>He went back in the dark to Wolfpits, heavily burdened with
the second part of his task.&nbsp; The children were playing
quietly on the hearthrug and Mrs Mumble, who considered it only
neighbourly to give Mary the benefit of her company in a domestic
emergency, was talking of homely, unimportant things with the
idea of distracting her mind from the more tragic affair that
held it.&nbsp; When Abner appeared she excused herself, kissed
the children good-night, enveloped Mary in a more significant
embrace, and left them.</p>
<p>Mary stood waiting for what he had to say.&nbsp; He could not
help recognising the contrast between her impressive aloofness,
her self-control, and the hysterics of old Mrs Malpas.&nbsp; She
could not pretend that she felt nothing; since George&rsquo;s
disaster, however little she might care for him, must bring with
it all sorts of complications.&nbsp; She was a woman who had been
used, in the lavish days of her father, to a certain degree of
comfort and <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>elegance, and even if she had known hard times at
Wolfpits during George&rsquo;s freakish periods of idleness, she
had never been faced with anything so threatening to herself and
her children as a complete stoppage of wages and, in the last
resort, the humiliation of parish relief.&nbsp; She waited with
her head erect, straight as a larch, in the perfect control of
her finely-tempered mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s what we thought it would be, missus,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Manslaughter they brought it in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; she asked, almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve took him in charge.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll
mean the lock-up at Lesswardine, time they&rsquo;ve got the case
ready for the police-court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment, and then:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does he want me to see him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t say nought of that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said reflectively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He said: &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em that I&rsquo;m all
right,&rdquo;&rsquo; Abner explained.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nowt
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Them</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s his mother . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;&nbsp; She stiffened a little, and Abner,
scenting a new hostility, continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This business bain&rsquo;t all George&rsquo;s
fault.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bit of bad luck that might have
happened to any one.&nbsp; It might just as well a&rsquo; been me
. . . as well and better.&nbsp; If that Bastard hadn&rsquo;t gone
at me from behind George&rsquo;d never have touched
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he&rsquo;d been home here,&rsquo; she interrupted,
with a sudden energy, &lsquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened at
all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s drink that&rsquo;s done for George,&rsquo;
she added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He hadn&rsquo;t a drap in him,&rsquo; said Abner
loyally.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was as sober as I am this minute.&nbsp;
He hadn&rsquo;t set foot in the place not half an
hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment, and then, with a curious
directness, asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where had he been then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How should I know where he&rsquo;d been?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t meddle or mak in George&rsquo;s affairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She pressed him: &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t it come out at the
inquest where he&rsquo;d been?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>He
saw how things were going, and lied brazenly in George&rsquo;s
defence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s one comfort,&rsquo; she said, with a
sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve borne enough shame from George
without that!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, as her suspicions flashed up
again: &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe you.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t let things like that pass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;m after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re all the same, you men!&nbsp; You think
women are simple enough to be put off with anything.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s you who are simple.&nbsp; Do you think we don&rsquo;t
know it?&nbsp; I know where George was that night as well as you
do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve known of his new fancy for three months
now.&nbsp; That woman and me have met one another on the road,
and looked at each other and smiled and passed the time of day
and not another word, because we knew, both of us, the thing was
best hidden and it would humble the two of us if it came to
light.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d let a thing
like that go at a coroner&rsquo;s inquest.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
waited for his reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They said he&rsquo;d been at Lesswardine.&nbsp; A widow
woman, they said, but they didn&rsquo;t tell her name.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you that&rsquo;s the lot.&nbsp; I was neyther
piller nor bo&rsquo;ster.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have told you at the
first, but I thought to save your feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Feelings!&rsquo; she repeated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s better ways of saving a woman&rsquo;s
feelings than keeping the truth from her.&nbsp; That was
George&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; If you guessed anything of what women
are like you&rsquo;d know that it&rsquo;s the truth they
want.&nbsp; You can forgive a man a lot if he doesn&rsquo;t lie
to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her tone changed suddenly.&nbsp; She became
dispassionate, practical, once more.&nbsp; &lsquo;When will it
come on at the police court?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I reckon they won&rsquo;t
keep him long at Lesswardine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall have to go there,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Even if he doesn&rsquo;t want me it&rsquo;s my place to be
there.&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t go there George will think that
I&rsquo;ve thrown him over.&nbsp; I would have come to-day if
he&rsquo;d let me, but he begged me not to.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
funny, like a child, is George.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>Her
voice softened when she spoke the last words, as though her
imagination had suddenly carried her back to the days of
George&rsquo;s courtship when her father was a hearty, prosperous
man and no troubles whatever had entered her life.&nbsp; For the
moment she seemed to Abner no more than a child herself.&nbsp; At
the first moment he had thought her insensitive, in the next she
had put him to shame by her frankness, now she was yielding,
pitiful.&nbsp; These alternations of stoicism, passion, and
tenderness bewildered him.&nbsp; He had not thought that women
were so various.&nbsp; In addition to this she was
beautiful.&nbsp; He wondered what perverse strain in George could
ever have compelled him to desert her.</p>
<p>After another long silence she thanked him for what he had
told her, then turned and left him.&nbsp; He heard her talking
brightly to the children as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Although darkness had fallen it was still early.&nbsp;
Abner&rsquo;s natural impulse would have bidden him walk back to
Mainstone and find Susie.&nbsp; It had been a torment to see her
cold and remote, seeming no more to him than a stranger.&nbsp; In
the hushed court-room when he had stolen out at the moment of
George&rsquo;s arrest she had not looked at him.&nbsp; He had
left her staring straight in front of her like a pious
churchgoer.&nbsp; He decided, in the end, to stay at Wolfpits,
for the night was cold and unhomely and he still carried in his
mind the sinister vision of the empty bar with Bastard&rsquo;s
body lying in the room behind it.&nbsp; More than this, he began
to be conscious of a definite duty toward Mary, whose attitude
had ended by filling him with admiration and loyalty.&nbsp; He
felt it in his bones that she despised him, being undeniably a
creature of finer clay than himself, but the moment in which she
had demanded his confidence remained with him.&nbsp; It was as
though the veil which had always hung between them had been
suddenly rent, admitting them to an intimacy as clear as
light.&nbsp; In all his life he had known no such
experience.&nbsp; Even in the most passionate moments of his
relation with Susie she had been no more to him than a strange
woman for whose beauty he hungered without reason.&nbsp; He knew
her body and thrilled to it, but of herself he knew
nothing.&nbsp; <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>With Mary it was different.&nbsp; At first he had felt
vaguely that he must be loyal to her for the sake of his friend,
not so much because he loved George as because their friendship
had been the immediate cause of their disaster.&nbsp; It was for
herself that he must now be loyal, and this seemed strange to
him, for it was an obligation which he had never considered as
possible between a man and a woman, and nothing but that sudden
moment of vision could have revealed it to him.</p>
<p>He devoted his evening to the children.&nbsp; Their frolic in
the snow had excited them.&nbsp; They were full of play and
laughter.&nbsp; Mary moved about her business silently, watching
the fireside group with benevolent eyes.&nbsp; At seven
o&rsquo;clock, just before their bedtime, another constable came
to the door with the police-court summons.&nbsp; The case had
been fixed for the following day&mdash;eleven o&rsquo;clock at
Lesswardine.&nbsp; The man was in a hurry to serve his other
summonses, and would not enter.&nbsp; Abner told Mary the
news.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; she repeated
intently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come thy ways, Morgan, love, time for
bye-byes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The children left Abner unwillingly, Gladys insisting that he
should carry her upstairs.&nbsp; He did so, and Mary followed
with her son in her arms, rubbing his cold-flushed eyelids with
his fists.</p>
<p>Abner returned to the fire.&nbsp; Eleven o&rsquo;clock!&nbsp;
Less than twenty-four hours ago none of this had happened.&nbsp;
He was impressed, in spite of himself, with the inevitable
regularity of the machine that had drawn George Malpas into its
ponderous clutches.&nbsp; He saw, for the first time, the
tremendous power of the law, and his own helplessness.</p>
<p>Mrs Mamble joined them for supper.&nbsp; When they had nearly
finished another knock came to the door, and Abner went to open
it.&nbsp; The new visitor was old Drew, who came in, blinking at
the light.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please come in, Mr Drew,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;and
take a seat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stood for a moment, a bowed and awkward figure.&nbsp; Then
he placed on the tablecloth three brown eggs that he had carried
in his huge misshapen hand.</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>&lsquo;I bringed you two three eggs, missus,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;m getting tarrable scarce these
days, and I reckon the chilring might like them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is good of you, Mr Drew,&rsquo; Mary cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee mention it!&rsquo; said the old
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;I rackon it won&rsquo;t be so aisy for
&rsquo;ee with the maister in trouble.&nbsp; Us all knows what
that be, and you&rsquo;m welcome to them.&nbsp; Iss, us all knows
what trouble be, praise God!&nbsp; I had a brother of my own to
Lapton Huish as was took for the killing of his wife, though the
poor twoad never knew what he done, for a&rsquo; suffered from
fits, a&rsquo; did.&nbsp; Tried and hanged into Exeter he were .
. . dear soul too!&nbsp; Iss, I know what trouble
manes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We all know what trouble means,&rsquo; said Mrs Mamble,
with a sigh, &lsquo;from the highest to the lowest; but the law
be kinder these days than it used to be.&nbsp; My poor dear
Robert&rsquo;s grandfather was a labourin&rsquo; man, a quiet,
Christian man too, as never raised a hand against any
livin&rsquo; creature, as Robert told me times, but that
weren&rsquo;t enough to save him from hanging.&nbsp; It was a
hard winter, I can&rsquo;t mind how many years agone, though
Robert he told me, and they got him for stealing a
sheep&mdash;stealing, they says!&mdash;as he found dead-stiff in
the snow on Clee Hills.&nbsp; As he&rsquo;d a right to, with the
fields like stone and no work and the children crying for
bread.&nbsp; But they hanged men for that in Worcester jail in
them days.&nbsp; Ay, and when my Robert was a lad, the other boys
&lsquo;d put it up against him as his dad had kept sheep by
moonlight: that&rsquo;s what they call hanging in chains, like
the gibbet, so they call it, as used to stand in olden times near
Clows Top.&nbsp; A quieter man never breathed, nor a better
worker.&nbsp; Put a bit more wood on the fire, Mr Fellows,
do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner threw a faggot on the fire and the flames leapt.&nbsp;
This friendly flicker, aided, perhaps, by the hypnotic drone of
Mrs Mamble&rsquo;s voice, as soothing as the sound of running
water or the midnight rustle of poplars, so encouraged the old
labourer that he let himself sink into a chair by the corner of
the table.</p>
<p>The firelight glinted in his beard, and Abner saw that his
full lips were red as those of a young man.&nbsp; He <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>saw also
Mary&rsquo;s face, withdrawn into the gloom.&nbsp; It seemed as
if she were dreaming, her mind altogether removed from the voices
of her comforters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Drew, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of men
that was strung up for stealing sheep down Exmoor way.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a many sheep on the moors, and ponies too.&nbsp;
You should see them when the foals come along, springtime, and
when they&rsquo;m drove down to Bampton fair.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
fine sight, sure &lsquo;nuff!&nbsp; But that there&rsquo;s
nothing to the old times.&nbsp; My granf&rsquo;er, &rsquo;er was
barn up Somerset, not too far from Ta&rsquo;nton, used to tell as
how men was stringed up by the dozen, the same as jays or
magpies, by a tarrable old chap of the name of Jeffereys.&nbsp;
Bloody Jeffereys, that&rsquo;s what they called &rsquo;en.&nbsp;
A judge he were. . . .&nbsp; Iss, bloody Jeffereys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now!&rsquo; said Mrs Mamble, throwing up her
hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And them they durs&rsquo;nt hang they sent off to
Canada, so I&rsquo;m told.&nbsp; Ay, many likely chaps was sent
there and never came home no more, though what they sent
&rsquo;en for I can&rsquo;t rightly call to mind, unless
&lsquo;twere rick-burning.&nbsp; Had the redcoats to &rsquo;em,
they did!&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s all past and gone,
thanks-be!&nbsp; Iss, past and gone. . . .&nbsp; The law
bain&rsquo;t what it used to be.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s juries these
days.&nbsp; An&rsquo; what be manslarter but a thing that might
come to any man unbeknownst?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee be
afeared, missus!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee be afeared!&nbsp;
There be no shame in &ldquo;going up the line,&rdquo; as they do
call it down our way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No shame, as you say, Mr Drew,&rsquo; said Mrs Mamble
solemnly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But the shame&rsquo;s not
everything.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a hard thing on a woman that has
little children with her crying for an empty belly when a
man&rsquo;s away in jail and not a penny in the house but what
the parish gives her.&nbsp; And the questions they ask!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s where the shame comes in, and I&rsquo;ve known many
a proud woman starve for a crust of bread rather than answer
them, they&rsquo;re that disgusting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, get away, do! woman,&rsquo; said old Drew, with a
laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s questions?&nbsp; And Mrs Malpas
here ban&rsquo;t going to do no such thing.&nbsp; A woman never
knows what friends she&rsquo;s got till she&rsquo;s found
trouble, and <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>they that has a roof to their heads and a bit of garden
to till can spare something for their neighbours.&nbsp; No,
don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee believe &rsquo;en, my dear!&nbsp; If
it&rsquo;s only potatoes and swede out of the fields, no chilring
&rsquo;ll starve to Wolfpits, not they!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
believe it!&nbsp; An&rsquo; a woman like your George&rsquo;s
mother with a tidy little business at the Buffalo. . . .&nbsp;
Trouble &rsquo;ll tell you your friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clock struck nine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s a fine thing to be sure,&rsquo; he
went on, with a glance of admiration, &lsquo;a fine thing to have
a clock to tell &rsquo;ee when to be going up over, and keep
&rsquo;ee company night-time.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis hard to judge the
hour in winter when the old sun be hid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pulled his stiff limbs together painfully, and left them
with more encouragements.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a quiet man,&rsquo; said Mrs Mamble, when
they heard him treading softly over the snow, &lsquo;but I always
reckoned he&rsquo;d be a good neighbour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She seemed loath to leave Mary to herself, and even proposed
that she should sleep with her, nominally for the sake of warmth,
until the strain of George&rsquo;s trial should be over, an offer
that Mary found it difficult to refuse with grace.&nbsp; When she
left them she took the younger woman to her breast and kissed her
tenderly.&nbsp; Abner opened the door for her, and when he
returned he saw that Mary&rsquo;s eyes were bright with
tears.&nbsp; He felt that he himself must struggle to add some
words of reassurance, but before he could do so she had said
good-night and vanished.</p>
<p>Next morning he rose early.&nbsp; He had lit the fire and made
the kettle boil before she was astir.&nbsp; When she heard his
feet in the kitchen she hurried to come down and thank him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t have done that,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s nowt,&rsquo; he replied bluntly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get on the road early.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast she deposited the children, as had been
arranged, with Mrs Mamble.&nbsp; Morgan, who scarcely ever left
his mother&rsquo;s side, resented this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, mam?&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only to Lesswardine with Abner here.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going for good, mam?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re coming back again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a silly boy, Morgan.&nbsp; Of course
I&rsquo;m coming back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When, mam?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A new anxiety seized him.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s for
dinner, mam?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A nice brown egg, my love, what Mr Drew brought
you,&rsquo; said Mrs Mamble, coming to the rescue.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You come along now, and you shall have dear Robert&rsquo;s
watch to play with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the last temptation Morgan succumbed.&nbsp; This watch was
the principal curiosity of Mrs Mamble&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp; It
hung there in the smell of rotting wood, a silver monster, like a
toy warming-pan, suspended in a celluloid case above the old
woman&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp; Mrs Mamble whipped them away, and Abner
set out with Mary.</p>
<p>Snow still covered the ground, but by this time, in lane and
road, the trampled ways were clear and the bordering drifts
marked with the treading of birds, squirrels, and other woodland
creatures.&nbsp; Abner was so unused to walking with a woman that
he set a pace that Mary could not equal.&nbsp; Breathless, she
begged him to walk more slowly.&nbsp; The exertion and the cold
air flushed her cheeks and reddened her lips to the hue of holly
and spindle-berries in the hedge.&nbsp; Her body glowed, and her
hair was bright as the fronds of bracken in the sun.&nbsp; In
spite of their tragic mission her lips smiled.&nbsp; No spiritual
anxiety could check the exhilaration of the blood that this crisp
winter morning gave her walking under the open sky.&nbsp; But
when they drew near to Lesswardine the houses closed in on them
like the walls of a prison; the fine snow was swept and sullied,
the light faded from the sky.</p>
<p>A special court had been summoned to deal with George&rsquo;s
case.&nbsp; The squire, Sir George Delahay, was driving down to
take the chair, and before Abner and Mary arrived the court-room
was nearly full of Lesswardine villagers who could always spare a
morning if anything sensational was passing.&nbsp; Abner, as one
of the principal witnesses, was soon separated from his <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>companion.&nbsp; He was herded together with the others
into a small block of chairs on the right-hand side of the bench
and opposite to the dock.&nbsp; From this point he could see the
court, a mass of white faces from which arose a rumour like the
buzzing of flies.&nbsp; In the midst of them he saw Mary, pale
and innocent.&nbsp; It was in her agony that these buzzing
tormentors would find delight.&nbsp; Almost on a level with her
at the other end of the bench he saw old Mrs Malpas.&nbsp; She
had come to the court as she would have come to chapel, in the
same dour, determined spirit, in the same tight black
dress.&nbsp; They sat abreast of one another, these two women to
whom George Malpas belonged, and not a glance passed between
them.</p>
<p>A new witness arrived, a fair young woman, clothed in black
and veiled, who walked in hurriedly with lowered eyes and tried
to conceal herself, as it seemed, behind the chairs of the
men.&nbsp; The flies buzzed as loudly as when they are driven
from a heap of filth.&nbsp; Abner guessed that this was
George&rsquo;s Lesswardine woman.&nbsp; Mrs Malpas darted one
eager glance in the new-comer&rsquo;s direction, but Mary did not
raise her eyes.&nbsp; At the last moment Mr Hind entered with
Susie.&nbsp; She smiled, and the sight of her made Abner&rsquo;s
blood leap, for she was no longer the white-faced impersonal
being that she had seemed at the inquest.&nbsp; She met his eyes
full, and smiled again.&nbsp; Mary also was looking at him
now.&nbsp; Abner went hot under their two glances.&nbsp; Why did
Mary look at him?&nbsp; The other was the woman that he
wanted!</p>
<p>In a sudden silence George was brought forward.&nbsp; He
seemed none the worse for his night in the cells.&nbsp; He walked
straight to the dock with a policeman on either side of him,
looking neither at his mother, whose hands went to her heart, nor
at Mary, who did not move.&nbsp; His eyes found Abner on the
opposite side of the court, and he smiled, but the smile suddenly
vanished and he went pale, for beyond Abner he had seen the face
of the woman from Lesswardine.&nbsp; He went pale with anger that
they should have dragged her into this; but there was no one on
whom his anger could fall.&nbsp; His hands, that had quickly
clutched at the edge of the dock, fell <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>to his
sides.&nbsp; He stood there with his fine, pale face and black
hair, and on him were centred the emotions of those three women
who would not look at each other.&nbsp; The court buzzed again,
going suddenly silent as Badger&rsquo;s master entered and took
his seat on the bench above the head of the clerk.</p>
<p>The proceedings were formal, being no more than another step
in George&rsquo;s journey to Salop.&nbsp; The only new witness
was the young woman whom the police had unearthed to establish
the sequence of George&rsquo;s movements on the night of
Bastard&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; She gave her evidence in a subdued
voice and never raised her eyes.&nbsp; She said that George had
never taken liquor in her house; that he had often come to see
her; that he was her friend.&nbsp; No more.</p>
<p>When she had left the box George gave a sigh of relief.&nbsp;
Abner wondered why he should have preferred this shrinking
creature to Mary or to Susie Hind.&nbsp; The sitting ended in the
obvious way, George being committed to take his trial at the
county assizes.&nbsp; Nothing else could have been expected.</p>
<p>At the door of the court Abner rejoined Mary.&nbsp; Mrs
Malpas, who had been whispering to the local solicitor, marched
past them without speaking, and Mary flushed at this deliberate
slight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She won&rsquo;t speak to me,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think that&rsquo;s too bad!&nbsp; That was Lawyer Harley
she was talking to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t take no notice of her,&rsquo; said
Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;That old woman&rsquo;s
half-cracked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went on to tell her that Mick Connor, who had gone to the
Buffalo out of curiosity the night before, had heard Mrs Malpas
tell one of her customers that if George were sent to Shrewsbury
she would employ the best criminal advocate on the circuit, even
if it cost her the last penny she possessed.&nbsp; He did not
tell her that Mrs Malpas had declared that it was nothing but the
proud ways of Mary, &lsquo;that thief&rsquo;s daughter,&rsquo;
she called her&mdash;that had driven George to his ruin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t look at me once,&rsquo; said Mary on
the way home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;d no call to look at nobody,&rsquo; Abner
replied.</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>&lsquo;He looked at <i>her</i>,&rsquo; said Mary
bitterly.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s strange.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what to make of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s natural enough.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t want
to see her dragged out in public.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dragged out in public?&rsquo; she cried, with an
unusual flush of spirit.&nbsp; &lsquo;What about
<i>me</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They settled down to another placid evening at Wolfpits.&nbsp;
The children had enjoyed their day with Mrs Mamble, though Morgan
was persuaded with difficulty to go to bed without the coveted
warming-pan under his pillow.&nbsp; Mrs Mamble was just preparing
to leave them for the night when a knock came to the door, and
without waiting for it to be opened to her Mrs Malpas
entered.&nbsp; Her walk to Wolfpits over the roadway, now
slippery with ice, had exhausted her, so that she looked more
like a wraith than a woman.&nbsp; Even so she did not stop to
recover her breath.&nbsp; She clenched her hands in the queer
gesture that Abner had noticed the evening before, and with
trembling wrists began to storm in Mary&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you done with the money?&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;What have you done with it?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Abner laid his hand on her shoulder, for she looked
dangerous.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take your hands off me!&rsquo; she screamed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The money. . . .&nbsp; I want my money!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo; Mary said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My money, you brazen madam!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The money out of the box in father&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp;
More than fifty pound . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo; repeated Mary,
bewildered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s gone . . . gone!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me
you don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s gone, when I know
you&rsquo;ve a&rsquo; had it!&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t have spent it
all.&nbsp; Give me what&rsquo;s left . . . to pay the
lawyers.&nbsp; George would never have gone and took it without
you to put him up to it . . . you with your lady&rsquo;s ways and
your fine speech!&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s where the bad blood
comes out.&nbsp; Your father was a thief, and you&rsquo;re no
better!&nbsp; Bad blood . . . bad blood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare . . .&rsquo; Mary cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare speak of my father!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>She
stood tall and flushed above her mother-in-law.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me the money . . . what&rsquo;s left of it,&rsquo;
Mrs Malpas pleaded.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give it me, and I won&rsquo;t
say no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her violence had spent itself.&nbsp; Now she was only small,
pathetic, withered.&nbsp; Mary controlled herself.&nbsp; She
would not answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d forgive him taking it. . . .&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
forgive him.&nbsp; Mr Harley says they&rsquo;ll want twenty pound
before they touch the case.&nbsp; Only twenty pound. . . .&nbsp;
I can find more later.&nbsp; Give me twenty pound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She says she don&rsquo;t know nothing about it,&rsquo;
said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Says</i>!&nbsp; It must have been George.&nbsp; No
one else knew where I kept it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s hidden it.&nbsp;
Up in his room.&nbsp; You must look . . . you must
look!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know nothing about it,&rsquo; said Mary, mastering
herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen a penny.&nbsp; I . . .
I can&rsquo;t talk to you.&nbsp; I wish you would go
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave the woman alone, missus,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s enough to put up with without you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d best go out quiet.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m not
answerable.&nbsp; Come on, now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old woman seemed to pull her strength together, looking
from one to the other.&nbsp; They waited for a new outburst, but
instead of speaking she suddenly threw up her hands and burst
into a fit of choking sobs.&nbsp; Mary made a compassionate
movement toward her, but Mrs Malpas stopped her with a violent
gesture.&nbsp; Then she straightened her bonnet and moved to the
door.&nbsp; She became her old, wiry, deliberate self.&nbsp; Her
voice was clear and her face like stone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If George took it,&rsquo; she said emphatically,
&lsquo;it was the devil that drove him, and I can&rsquo;t do no
more.&nbsp; But not one penny shall you ever get out of me, Mary
Condover.&nbsp; You can starve, you and your children together,
but don&rsquo;t come crying to dad and me.&nbsp; You and your
pride. . . .!&nbsp; Now you can see what you&rsquo;ve to be proud
of.&nbsp; The daughter of a thief and the wife of a thief.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what you are!&nbsp; I never want to set eyes on you
again . . . you and your fancy lodger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went out, leaving the door open behind her.&nbsp; Mary
stood looking after her, shaken like a tree in the wind.&nbsp;
Then she gave a curious laugh and sat down at <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>the
table.&nbsp; Abner could do nothing for her; but she managed to
contain herself until she had risen and passed from his sight
upstairs.</p>
<p>It was fortunate for them all in the suspense that now held
them that the Shrewsbury assizes had been fixed for the middle of
December, immediately before the Christmas vacation.&nbsp; On his
committal by the Lesswardine bench, George had been taken at once
to the county jail where he lay awaiting his trial.&nbsp; In the
meantime the leisurely routine of work in those wintry valleys,
disturbed so abruptly by these violent events, reasserted
itself.&nbsp; The snow melted.&nbsp; To the sodden days of thaw
succeeded a period of mild and mistily golden weather that would
have seemed like spring had it not been so silent.&nbsp; The work
on the pipeline began again like the progress of some great
engine that had kept its power hissing beneath the snow, and
daily gathered speed.&nbsp; Even the Pound House, still suspect
by the police but happily safe until the Brewster sessions,
regained its old popularity, though Mr Hind, having been duly
warned, gave more attention to his business than ever
before.&nbsp; It had been clear from the first that he had taken
a violent dislike to Abner, whom he regarded as the cause of all
his trouble.&nbsp; On the day of the inquest he had shown this by
his silence; but when Abner appeared again at the inn, he told
him in as many words that his custom wasn&rsquo;t wanted.&nbsp;
Susie, a little shaken by her father&rsquo;s severity, implored
him not to persist in coming to the Pound House, and though she
appeared no less passionately devoted to Abner, the lovers&rsquo;
meetings were fewer and their secrecy more precarious.</p>
<p>It was strange how little difference George&rsquo;s absence
made to life at Wolfpits.&nbsp; Within a week it almost seemed as
if the place and its inhabitants had forgotten him.&nbsp; Neither
Mary nor the children ever mentioned his name, and since the day
of the police-court proceedings Abner had heard nothing from him
but a single scribbled letter which George contrived to send from
the lock-up by the hand of the young policeman who had drunk his
beer.&nbsp; In this letter a new flicker of care for his family
had shown itself: he had reminded <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>Abner of his promise to stay at
Wolfpits and look after them.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would have sent you
some money,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;but they&rsquo;ve taken it
off me.&nbsp; Mary can ask mother if she&rsquo;s in a
fix.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reminder was quite unnecessary.&nbsp; Abner
had given his word to a pal and meant to stick to it, though he
foresaw a difficult moment when the plan should be disclosed to
Mary.&nbsp; He could not see, for the life of him, how to open
the subject, and so he let things take their course, waiting for
the occasion to arrive without his interference.</p>
<p>It came, as he had half expected, at the end of the week, when
the next payment for his lodging was due.&nbsp; Instead of his
usual fourteen shillings he gave Mary the whole of his wages
wrapped up in the piece of paper in which he received them at the
works.&nbsp; The situation embarrassed her, as she told him, for
she had no change.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want none,&rsquo; he said bluntly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t take it from you,&rsquo; she
protested.&nbsp; &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right or wrong,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you and the
children can&rsquo;t live on less, and you&rsquo;ll find it a
tight pinch as it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t take it,&rsquo; she said again.</p>
<p>They stood on either side of the table with the packet of
money between them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t only that,&rsquo; she added.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose I think the less of your kindness. . .
.&nbsp; I wish I could tell you what I do think . . . but
I&rsquo;m afraid it isn&rsquo;t right for you to stay on here now
George is away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why I ought to stay,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Men don&rsquo;t think of such things.&nbsp; It would be
the talk of the village.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d say there was
something wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As long as there bain&rsquo;t nothing wrong
there&rsquo;s no harm in talk.&nbsp; Talk never hurt
nobody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s George&rsquo;s mother . . . you
don&rsquo;t know her!&nbsp; Remember what she said that
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d ever take the upper hand of
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no . . . it&rsquo;s not me,&rsquo; she said
quickly, turning away from him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then there&rsquo;s no call to be soft over
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s George, too . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret yourself about George,&rsquo; he
said, and <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>showed her her husband&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what George thinks about it.&nbsp; I reckon
that&rsquo;s good enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For a long time she would not take his money.&nbsp; The hard
facts of her case, the words of Mrs Malpas, and the ugly
necessity of applying for parish relief, seemed to weigh less
with her than this tyrannous modesty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can take it or leave it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but
I&rsquo;ve promised George and the money will come to you just
the same. . . .&nbsp; Supposing I get another lodge, the money
will be less, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; If you bain&rsquo;t afeard
of me . . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>She protested: &lsquo;No . . . no . . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I may as well stay on.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t do
without a man in a place like this.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the wood
to chop and the water to draw and that.&nbsp; I should have to
come here just the same.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to live on a poor
wage, and it&rsquo;s all the better if I&rsquo;m here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must think it over,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>In the end she consented to his staying&mdash;happily for
herself since otherwise life would have been almost
impossible.&nbsp; During the three weeks that passed before
George&rsquo;s trial, they settled down into a new and orderly
condition, living poorly, it is true, but contentedly, and aided
by the attentions of their neighbours.&nbsp; Mrs Mamble, perhaps
at Mary&rsquo;s request, often softened the awkwardness of the
situation by dropping in about supper-time and staying to talk
over the fire, and old Drew was continually giving the children
presents of eggs from his own fowl-yard, farm-produce from the
land on which he worked, and even some of the milk which,
according to the custom in those parts, he received in part
payment of his wage.&nbsp; Mary could not refuse these gifts so
beautifully given; she could not even return him adequate thanks;
but she tried to add a little to the comfort of the rooms in
which the old man lived, and offered to attend to his clothes, an
attempt in which she failed, since Drew always locked his door
when he left it in the dawn, resenting, in the manner of many
bachelors, the least interference with his own homely dirt, and
wore in winter every shred of clothing that he possessed.</p>
<p>The sense of an obligation unfulfilled would have <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>made them
awkward if the old man had not accepted the help of Abner in his
garden, a proceeding that he watched with suspicion, being as
fidgety as any old maid, and that of Mary in the feeding of his
fowls.&nbsp; Within a few weeks, indeed, the inhabitants of
Wolfpits had settled down into a kind of communal life that was
happy if only for the fact that its existence implied so much
goodwill.</p>
<p>The subpoenas for the assizes arrived, and with them a new
wave of rumour and excitement troubled the villages.&nbsp; It was
agreed that George had no chance of being acquitted, but those
who had experience of the law vied with those who had none in
predicting the term of his sentence.&nbsp; Through the medium of
Susie, Pound House gossip filtered back to Abner, and in this way
he learned that Mrs Malpas had managed in spite of her loss to
brief a barrister named Rees, who had a great reputation for
skill in criminal defences on that circuit.&nbsp; A week before
the trial Abner received a note from the lesser of the two local
solicitors, who, being a liberal and a nonconformist, had nothing
to lose by an implied opposition to the squire.&nbsp; Together
with Mick Connor and Atwell, Abner repeated his version of the
affair to this man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall let Mrs Malpas, senior, know by wire when the
case is likely to come on,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and you, of
course, will hold yourselves in readiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A fortnight later Mrs Malpas sent up a message by a small boy
from Chapel Green to Wolfpits, telling Abner that it would be
necessary to set out for Shrewsbury on the following
morning.&nbsp; The message made no mention of Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I shall go all the same,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>They left Wolfpits in darkness, whispering their farewells to
Mrs Mamble for fear of waking the children, whom Mary, dressing
quietly, had left asleep.&nbsp; The nearest station to Chapel
Green was that of Llandwlas, a minute hamlet hidden amid the
springs of the Barbel, a little to the north of the single line
that winds painfully out of Wales between the dominant masses of
the forests of Radnor and Clun.&nbsp; From Wolfpits,
cross-country, this made a five-mile walk.&nbsp; A dripping mist
<a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>hid the
land, and they saw no soul until they reached the station.&nbsp;
There, on the raw, deserted platform, where the porter had lit a
single oil lamp to show that the day had begun, they waited,
walking up and down to keep themselves warm.&nbsp; They were
early, and the only other sign of life was the yellow square of
the stationmaster&rsquo;s bedroom in the adjoining cottage.&nbsp;
Even if daylight had come, the density of the mist would have
given them the same sense of isolation.&nbsp; Little by little
the place became alive: first a float drove up with a couple of
milk-cans; next came a gnomish figure who carried a stick, with
dead rabbits slung from it over his shoulder: then a noisy party
of two, whom Abner recognised as his fellow-witnesses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Connor and Atwell come up,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s keep at the other end,&rsquo; Mary
whispered, moving away.</p>
<p>Two more traps arrived, the first containing the Hinds, the
second Badger, alone, and last, the small, energetic figure of
George&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; All these people, whom a chance blow
had precipitated into the same grim business, stood waiting for
the train singly or in isolated groups of two.&nbsp; A straining
of wires was heard, and the fogged, red eye of the signal changed
to green.&nbsp; The stationmaster threw up the shutter of the
booking office with a rattle.&nbsp; Abner found himself wedged in
front of the window between Badger and Mr Hind.&nbsp; Mrs Malpas,
fidgeting with her purse, stood waiting in the background.&nbsp;
As Abner rejoined Mary, a sound of distant panting was heard, and
a minute later the front of the engine loomed enormous through
the fog.&nbsp; They entered a third-class smoker at the end of
the train.&nbsp; The milk-cans were rolled over the echoing
platform into the van, and the train moved off with a clank of
couplings and a hiss of white steam.&nbsp; Down through the
valleys, mile on mile they wound.&nbsp; The train rocked on the
gradients until it seemed that the carriages must touch the black
edge of the woods.&nbsp; The mist turned white and
dazzling.&nbsp; The sun had risen.</p>
<h2><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>The
Sixteenth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> nightfall on the same evening
that train of old-fashioned coaches came blundering back along
the curves of the Llandwlas line.&nbsp; The snorting of its
engine was the only sound, as its yellow windows and
fire-belching funnel were the only light, in all those miles of
woodland and valley.&nbsp; The train ran late as usual,
stuttering up the gradients as though the weight it carried were
too much for the power of its groaning pistons.</p>
<p>Scattered through the various compartments of its three short
coaches sat all the witnesses of George&rsquo;s
condemnation.&nbsp; The jury, having no alternative, had found
him guilty of manslaughter, and the judge, who saw in front of
him a programme of cases more important than this flicker of
violence in a remote agricultural district, wasted no time on his
sentence.&nbsp; If Bastard had not been a policeman, and
therefore a humble symbol of the code which his lordship
administered, if the witness Badger had not been a gamekeeper,
which was much the same thing, George might easily have escaped
with a few months&rsquo; imprisonment, or half a year&rsquo;s at
most.&nbsp; The barrister whom Mrs Malpas had employed for the
defence realised this.&nbsp; The fact that he was most eager to
establish seemed to be that George was not, and had never been, a
poacher, and that he was not on bad terms with the man he had
killed.&nbsp; Mrs Malpas, sitting in the public gallery on the
bench in front of Mary, listened eagerly.&nbsp; Her heart sank as
she listened to the evidence, the words that she had heard before
in the police-court at Lesswardine, for she had expected that the
little man in the gray wig who had shaken hands with her an hour
before in consideration of the thirty pounds that she had scraped
together to pay him, would throw some new and startling light
upon the case, reducing Badger to tears and confounding the
Lesswardine police.&nbsp; She had expected thunders and
passionate appeals to the <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>mercy of the jury.&nbsp; Instead of
this he spoke in a low voice, with a Jewish lisp, and even
cracked a joke, at which the jury smiled, with one of the
witnesses for the prosecution.&nbsp; The old woman felt that she
had been betrayed.&nbsp; Seeking ideal justice she had found
something trivial and cynical.&nbsp; The whole business was
nearly over before she realised that it had begun.&nbsp; The
judge summed up lazily, only pitching his voice when he dwelt
upon the necessity of such men as Bastard to the public safety
and the very existence of property.&nbsp; The jury retired for
less than two minutes.&nbsp; The judge gave sentence of eighteen
months&rsquo; hard labour, and the white face of George, who had
stood like a statue throughout the trial, disappeared from the
dock.&nbsp; When she looked again she saw that another man, who
looked like a tramp, had entered it.&nbsp; People around her
began to talk, for this was a case of real murder, and this
mean-looking creature was to fight for his life.&nbsp; Only then
did the old woman realise that George&rsquo;s case was
over.&nbsp; She passed Mary in the door of the gallery and
hurried downstairs, where the counsel whom she had briefed
congratulated her on the issue of the case.&nbsp; While she was
engaged with him and with Harley, the solicitor, Mary passed her
and joined Abner on the steps of the court.&nbsp; Mrs Malpas, in
the middle of her conversation, gave them a queer sidelong glance
that filled Mary with uneasiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think we had better go home
together,&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on and get a spot of tea,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I reckon you must be clammed, and there&rsquo;s near an
hour before the train goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It made her flurried and impatient to think that Abner had not
understood her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to be with me,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s watching us.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let her watch!&rsquo; said Abner, looking round in a
way that made Mrs Malpas sure that they had been speaking of
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come on . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she slipped away from him in the crowd outside the steps
so quickly that he could not very well follow her with
dignity.&nbsp; At the same moment Connor and <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>Atwell
appeared and solved his perplexity by dragging him off into a
public-house.&nbsp; Mick gave the ball a kick, as he called it,
with a round of Irish whisky.&nbsp; None of them had tasted any
food since they left their homes before dawn, and the spirit soon
went into Abner&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; They sat in a corner of the
bar, laughing uproariously at Mick&rsquo;s ridiculous stories,
and making outrageous plans for getting their own back on
Badger.&nbsp; Indeed, if the clock in the bar had not struck to
warn them of the time, they would have missed their train.&nbsp;
They had to hurry down the steep hill to Shrewsbury
station.&nbsp; Lights were gleaming in the muddy streets and in
the windows of tall, half-timbered houses.&nbsp; Above them hung
the threatening mass of the castle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s where poor old George will get his
lodging,&rsquo; said Mick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This time eighteen month . . .&rsquo; said Atwell
solemnly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, not at all,&rsquo; said Mick.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sure
he&rsquo;ll be out and about next winter, if he plays his
game.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the station they found they had still a few minutes to
spare, and Abner&rsquo;s hazy intention of looking for Mary was
lost in another rush to the third-class refreshment-room.&nbsp;
Just before the train started he ran along the carriages to see
if he could find her.&nbsp; In one carriage he saw Mrs Malpas, in
another three Lesswardine policemen, in a third Mr Hind was
sitting with Susie, who smiled at him.&nbsp; Mary was nowhere to
be seen.&nbsp; Mick pulled him into a smoker as the train was
starting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God help me!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is it crazed you
are that you can&rsquo;t leave the woman five minutes to
herself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be seeing all you want of her time
her George comes out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Atwell laughed stupidly.&nbsp; Abner jumped up in a rage and
was for throwing Connor through the window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, be quiet now!&rsquo; Mick persuaded, &lsquo;for I
don&rsquo;t mane a word of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner settled down sulkily.&nbsp; Atwell had already forgotten
the incident and was snoring in his corner.&nbsp; Mick hummed
quietly the song about Macarthy, spitting through a chink in the
window between the verses.&nbsp; The train jolted on into the
darkness, crossing <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>the deep valley of Severn, skirting the eastern
foothills of the Long Mynd, sliding down with braked engine into
the basin of Teme.&nbsp; At Craven Arms a Welsh cattle dealer
joined them, a small, red-bearded man, who eyed them suspiciously
and would not be drawn into talk with Mick Connor.&nbsp; The
train climbed painfully, the air grew colder.&nbsp;
Atwell&rsquo;s snores joined with the clanking of the wheels to
set a spell of drowsiness on Abner&rsquo;s fuddled brain.&nbsp;
He fell asleep.</p>
<p>At Llandwlas Mick woke him.&nbsp; They tumbled out on to the
deserted platform.&nbsp; Mary was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; She
had slipped him again, and though he was inclined to be angry at
this unreasonable conduct he submitted to Mick&rsquo;s suggestion
that they should walk back to Chapel Green together and get
another drink.&nbsp; Two traps passed them on the road, flinging
an uncertain light upon the frosty hedges.&nbsp; From the first
of them Susie called good-night; in the second they could see the
helmets of the police, but no trace either of Mrs Malpas or Mary
was to be seen on the road.</p>
<p>The sleep had cleared Abner&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; They walked
quickly through the raw air and in a little more than an hour
they saw the poplars of Chapel Green.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about a drop at the Buffalo?&rsquo; said Mick.</p>
<p>Even from a distance they could see that this forbidding
resort had become unusually cheerful.&nbsp; It was now the time
of evening at which the labouring men who formed the greater part
of Mrs Malpas&rsquo;s customers finished their quarts and went
home to bed.&nbsp; As the three men approached, many voices were
heard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sounds as if there&rsquo;s a drop
stirrin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said Mick.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the houly,
an&rsquo; so there will be!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the Pound House,
after being closed on them with Mr Hind and Susan
away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door and a mist of tobacco smoke met the colder
air.&nbsp; At the same moment a tall musical box, shaped like a
grandfather clock and worked by a penny-in-the-slot apparatus,
struck up the tune of Champagne Charlie.&nbsp; In front of it,
beating time with a pint pot, dangerously full, stood Wigan
Joe.&nbsp; The man was three-parts drunk, as were most of the
other cloggers who crowded the bar.&nbsp; At his right hand, next
<a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>the
fire, sat old Mr Malpas, following with anxious eyes the
evolutions of the big man&rsquo;s tankard.&nbsp; The room was so
full of smoke and occupied by the jingle of the musical box that
Abner and his friends entered without the clogger realising that
they were there. . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good rousing tune, lad,&rsquo; he cried,
leaning over Mr Malpas and beating out the rhythm with his free
hand on the old man&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Eh, it&rsquo;s
a grand night is this.&nbsp; Makes you feel like you&rsquo;re
young again.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have another bloody
penn&rsquo;orth!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr Malpas nodded, smiling
feebly.</p>
<p>Fumbling in his pocket for the coin, he became aware of Abner,
Mick, and Atwell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By gum, lads, is that you?&nbsp; Tell us quick
what&rsquo;s happened . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They give him eighteen months,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The b&mdash;s!&rsquo; said Joe under his breath.&nbsp;
He took them aside and explained that he and his mates had
thought that old Mr Malpas would be lonely-like with George in
trouble and his missus away.&nbsp; &lsquo;We thought we&rsquo;d
stay in and brighten things up a bit to take his mind off it
like.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve had a nice bit of harmony,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Eighteen months!&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s a
b&mdash; that is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the musical box, after one or two metallic
protests, inharmoniously stopped in the middle of its
chorus.&nbsp; Joe threw a penny to the man who sat nearest to
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Ere, put in another copper,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;an&rsquo; wind the blasted thing oop.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The clockwork grated and the tune began again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word to the old &rsquo;un,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Keep his mind off it: that&rsquo;s the
ticket.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this end in view he left them and poked old Malpas, who
had now relapsed into a state of nodding imbecility, in the
ribs.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you see that there gun, dad?&rsquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>Malpas stared vaguely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gun,&rsquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
go telling me you don&rsquo;t know what a gun is!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
pointed to an old muzzle loader that hung above the hearth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, ay . . . gun!&rsquo; said Old Malpas blandly.&nbsp;
Wigan Joe bent over him and began to declaim in <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>his ear an
endless, and, as it seemed, pointless story, of how he had once
gone out with a friend to shoot crows; how he had seen a crow on
a haystack on the parish boundary, and how his friend, after
taking careful aim, had missed it.&nbsp; At this point he raised
his voice still louder.&nbsp; &lsquo;By gum, lad,&rsquo; I says,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;re the first ever I knew that shot at a haystack
and missed a parish!&rsquo;&nbsp; With the last words he gave the
old man a hearty slap on the back, and Malpas collapsed into a
feeble fit of laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shot at a haystack and missed a parish,&rsquo; the
clogger repeated, roaring at his own joke, and presenting it to
the company, who were now in a condition to laugh at
anything.</p>
<p>At the same moment the door opened and Mrs Malpas
entered.&nbsp; Joe steadied himself, the others were silent at
the sight of her small, tragic figure, only the musical box
continued to jangle out its tune and the old man to be shaken
with equally mechanical chuckles.&nbsp; She did not speak, but
took in the whole assembly with her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Evening, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the clogger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been giving the old gentleman a bit of a tune
to liven him up like, and make him forget his
troubles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Without answering, she stepped straight over to the musical
box and pulled a lever that stopped it.&nbsp; Then she shook the
shoulder of her husband, who had not yet realised her coming.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up with you, dad?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Are you stark mad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, mother,&rsquo; he replied
feebly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; Then she turned on the
others.&nbsp; &lsquo;Out of this!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Out of this, every one of you. . . .&nbsp; As if there
wasn&rsquo;t enough shame and sorrow in this house without your
mocking it with your drink and your music.&nbsp; Out of it, I
say!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she waved her arms as though she were
driving cattle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t take on so, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Wigan Joe mildly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was all meant for the
best.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you let the man forget his
troubles?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a poor heart that never
rejoices!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me!&rsquo; she cried
angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;To think <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>that you have the face to come here,
you that led him astray with your drink and your bawdiness!&nbsp;
To come and make a mock of his own father!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell on Abner, who had risen to go to the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that man!&rsquo; she cried, whipping herself up
into a white paroxysm of rage.&nbsp; &lsquo;That man who, if all
had their rights, would be in the dock and in the prison where my
son is lying!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the man he&rsquo;s suffering
for!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the serpent he took into his
bosom!&rsquo;&nbsp; She stood before Abner spitting like a snake
herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never let me see your face again!&rsquo;
she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never come nigh this door.&nbsp; It was
the devil that sent you to bring trouble on a good Christian
house!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again Wigan Joe protested the innocence of his intentions,
while the old man sat nodding by the fire as if the storm had
broken without him knowing it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;with
the liquor in your breath.&nbsp; Go away and leave us
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner went out.&nbsp; The other men were standing on the
pavement laughing.&nbsp; Mick implored him to go on with them to
the Pound House where Mr Hind and Susie had by this time
presumably arrived, but he shook his head and took the road to
Wolfpits, pondering, through the darkness of night, on the
curious turn which his fortune had taken.</p>
<p>He had now time to think about Mary, and the unreasonable
obstinacy she had shown in leaving him on the steps of the court
and later avoiding him both at Shrewsbury and Llandwlas.&nbsp; He
felt a little concerned that she should have chosen to walk so
many miles cross-country through the dark rather than submit to
his company.&nbsp; After all it would have been only natural for
them to go home together; he had always treated her with respect,
and there was nothing in the history of their acquaintance that
should have made her shy of him, nothing&mdash;unless it were
perhaps that one curious moment on the night when they had
carried George upstairs between them and put him to bed.&nbsp;
Then he had told her, in George&rsquo;s defence, of his own
intimacy with Susie Hind, and this revelation, instead of putting
her at ease, as it should have done, <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>had actually seemed to embarrass
her.&nbsp; This knowledge, however, gave her no reason for her
present behaviour.&nbsp; Indeed, if she knew him to be so thick
with Susie, there was surely less cause than ever for her to be
shy with him herself.&nbsp; He gave women up&mdash;you never knew
where you were with them.&nbsp; He supposed that nothing but fear
of Mrs Malpas was at the bottom of Mary&rsquo;s queer
behaviour.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to be with me:
she&rsquo;s watching us,&rsquo; she had said when she gave him
the slip at Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Another memory of Mrs Malpas
returned to him: the end of her outburst at Wolfpits when she had
come in search of her money.&nbsp; &lsquo;You and your fancy
lodger!&rsquo; she had screamed.&nbsp; Abner laughed to
himself.&nbsp; It was clear that Mary hadn&rsquo;t much of a
fancy for him at present.</p>
<p>All the same he couldn&rsquo;t entirely dismiss Mrs Malpas
from his thoughts.&nbsp; She had shown herself definitely hostile
to him, and his last vision of her clearing the bar of the
Buffalo, a puny figure with white cheeks, burning eyes, and
nodding plume of jet, showed him her fanatical strength, stronger
for the fact that she regarded herself in her most violent
moments as a representative of the right and the rest of the
world as inspired by the devil.&nbsp; Yet he couldn&rsquo;t get
away from the ludicrous side of her, and found himself chuckling
in the dark, &lsquo;Poor old soul&rsquo; he thought.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She dain&rsquo;t know what she wants, and that&rsquo;s the
truth!&rsquo;&nbsp; But Mrs Malpas did know what she wanted.</p>
<p>Mary had gone to bed when he reached Wolfpits, but she had
left his supper ready on the kitchen table.&nbsp; He ate his
bread and cheese and drank his beer.&nbsp; That night, exhausted
with the strain of the day, he slept heavily.</p>
<p>So the new life began.&nbsp; If George Malpas, lying in
Shrewsbury Jail, returned, in one of the debauches of sentiment
to which his nature was subject, to the idea of his desolate wife
and family, and dwelt on it with pity or remorse, he might well
have spared himself the luxury of these emotions.&nbsp; There
were few changes at Wolfpits.&nbsp; The children knew that they
need no longer expect the violent attentions which George gave
them when he felt like it; Spider, the bitch, settled <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>down to a
life untroubled by George&rsquo;s kicks and stones; while Mary,
that strange and secret creature, was spared at least the
alternations of reproaches and endearments which made up the
greater part of her marriage.&nbsp; George had vanished from her
life.&nbsp; For three months at least no word, no sign from him
might reach her.&nbsp; It was true that the family had to live
more simply.&nbsp; Abner&rsquo;s wages, which she now took
without question every Saturday night, could buy them nothing
more than the absolute necessities of life, and, even so, must be
spent with care; but it pleased her to think that she was
managing on them and that not one penny went on frivolous
things.</p>
<p>Abner himself kept back no more than a couple of shillings for
tobacco every week.&nbsp; To drink was out of the question, and
it now seemed to him fortunate that Mr Hind, in a fit of temper,
should have warned him off the Pound House.&nbsp; He now spent
most of his evenings at home sitting before the fire, with Gladys
on his knee, and making catapults or other wooden weapons for
Morgan with his knife.&nbsp; Even in so small a household as
theirs there was plenty of rough work that a man could do, not
only in the way of digging and dressing the garden and hewing
wood for the fires, but actually in patching up the crumbled
fabric of Wolfpits which, left to the mercies of rain and frost,
would have fallen about their heads.&nbsp; The sudden intimacy
with their neighbours into which George&rsquo;s arrest had thrown
them, continued, and the more Abner detached himself from the
life of the cloggers and of his own mates, the more sufficient
did this isolated communal life of Wolfpits become.&nbsp; It was
the most peaceful and natural that he had ever lived, and he grew
to love it for its regularity and calm.</p>
<p>The only force that tended to drag him out of this centripetal
existence was Susie.&nbsp; Whatever her father might think of
Abner, and however little he might come to the Pound House, she
had no intention of giving up a man to whom she had taken such a
passionate fancy.&nbsp; Of all those with whom she came in
contact in Mainstone, Abner had pleased her best, being more
completely her opposite than any of the others.&nbsp; His <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>fairness,
his strength, and a certain innocence in his composition, had
made her choose him for her own, and even though he found the
relation exacting and occasionally inconvenient, Abner was still
under the spell of her physical attraction.&nbsp; Indeed there
seemed to be no fear of this being exhausted, for their meetings
were necessarily rarer and therefore more enthralling.</p>
<p>In the regularity of his new life at Wolfpits lurked the
obvious disadvantage that Abner&rsquo;s visits to Susie became
conspicuous.&nbsp; Mary knew better than to question him on his
movements&mdash;pride, as well as the tact which she had learned
in her experience of George forbade her to do so&mdash;but when
Abner returned late at night from these assignations she would
look at him queerly, and a silence and restraint out of which she
could not school herself, made it evident that she resented the
mystery.&nbsp; He wished, indeed, that she would ask him where he
had been, for then he would have been able to put her off with
some deliberate lie which she could believe or reject as she
pleased.&nbsp; Anything, he felt, was better than this
uncomfortable chill, this shy curiosity of gaze, this
silence.&nbsp; It was a condition of affairs that he could not
stand and made him anxious, beyond all considerations of
prudence, to blurt out his secret&mdash;if secret it
were&mdash;and dissolve the grudging air of mystery with which
she received him.</p>
<p>One night when he had come home late and could stand her
silence no longer, he said suddenly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where d&rsquo;you reckon I&rsquo;ve been
to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed, and she made a slight gesture of annoyance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never met a woman yet who didn&rsquo;t want to know
where a man had been,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She turned her back on him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you lock the
door and put out the lamp?&rsquo; she said coldly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the Pound House,&rsquo; he
volunteered, watching her all the time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have thought you&rsquo;d had enough of the
Pound House,&rsquo; she was tempted to reply bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To see Susie Hind . . .&rsquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So now you know, missus.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>He
wished, perversely, that she would turn on him and tell him what
she thought of him.&nbsp; It would have cleared the air.&nbsp;
Instead of this she spoke calmly and almost scornfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you want to tell me this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because a woman&rsquo;s always itching to
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think I didn&rsquo;t know it
already?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she repeated her first words:
&lsquo;Please lock the door and put the lamp out,&rsquo; and left
him.</p>
<p>This made things no better.&nbsp; He had wanted to justify
himself, or, at any rate, to brazen the matter out.&nbsp; He
wanted to pierce her armour of reserve, to see her as she
was.&nbsp; Whether she were jealous or merely actively scornful
didn&rsquo;t matter as long as she showed herself to be alive and
tangible.&nbsp; He wanted to feel the shock of their two wills,
their two persons clashing without this irritating veil in which
she hid herself intervening.&nbsp; Whether it were love or hate
he wanted to feel some definite contact with her: something
comparable with the moment when she had spoken to him of
George&rsquo;s woman at Lesswardine.&nbsp; This she denied
him.&nbsp; It was unreasonable that she should behave in this way
to the man on whose charity, if he put it at the bluntest, she
was now living.&nbsp; It seemed as if she had made the
maintenance of this spiritual remoteness the condition of her
dependence on him.&nbsp; He felt, vaguely, that she wasn&rsquo;t
playing the game, and explained her attitude to himself as the
result of her unnatural fear of old Mrs Malpas&rsquo;s
tongue.&nbsp; He was tempted, at times, to throw in his hand, to
launch out again, to leave Chapel Green and let her go her own
way.&nbsp; He pretended to himself that his promise to George, an
obligation that went a good deal deeper than friendship,
restrained him; but he knew in his heart that even if he had not
undertaken the care of George&rsquo;s wife he would never have
left Wolfpits.&nbsp; He only wished that her pride, or whatever
it was, would let her be reasonable.</p>
<p>Susie wasn&rsquo;t like that.&nbsp; With Susie he knew exactly
where he was.&nbsp; She had even, once or twice, shown herself
jealous of his devotion to Mary, and tried to read into it an
intimacy which was very far removed <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>from their real state.&nbsp; She had
seen Mary in the police-court and in the gallery at the assizes,
had recognised her beauty and the dignity which contrasted so
deeply with her own abandon.&nbsp; She would ask Abner questions
about her, implying that Mary must be jealous of his visits to
Mainstone, in this way half convincing Abner that it was
unnatural for her not to be jealous, and aggravating his
grievance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose she takes your money and then treats you like
dirt,&rsquo; she said scornfully.&nbsp; And Abner could not be
sure that she hadn&rsquo;t described the situation exactly.</p>
<p>Christmas came and passed: a meagre Christmas such as their
means imposed upon them.&nbsp; The morning was bright, and Mary
took the children to church.&nbsp; In the evening Mrs Mamble and
old Drew joined them, and in their company the bearing of Mary
curiously lightened.&nbsp; She became young and gay, almost
childish.&nbsp; There was laughter in her eyes and her cheeks
were flushed with firelight.&nbsp; The old labourer had brought
with him a bottle of cowslip wine that he had made in the spring,
and they sat together late into the night telling stories of
forgotten people and distant counties.&nbsp; About midnight the
others left them, and though her attitude sensibly changed, a
little of the glow was left in Mary&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Last Christmas,&rsquo; she said musingly, &lsquo;we all
went down to the Buffalo in the evening&mdash;George and me and
the children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner also remembered.&nbsp; He told her of his own Christmas
at Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages, how John Fellows had been in
hospital with his broken thigh and he had been left alone with
Alice and little John.&nbsp; Mary leaned forward and listened to
him in the firelight with her soft eyes fixed upon his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it her you wrote that letter to?&rsquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The one you wanted to post?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I could save you the trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes . . . that was her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How old was she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somewhere about the same as you, I reckon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And two children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, only one kid.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>&lsquo;How long was he . . . I mean your father . . .
in hospital?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty nigh six month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you had to keep the house going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I had.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t nought coming
in except his club, and that bain&rsquo;t nothing to speak
on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Six months . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; She stared into the fire,
and there was a long silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s funny,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; she said at last, without raising her
eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Funny how things turn out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a rum go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she began slowly to question him about Alice: what was
she like, fair or dark, how tall, the kind of dress she
wore&mdash;curious details that he had to search his memory to
answer.&nbsp; She seemed to be working out for herself the
obvious parallel, but never looked at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you leave them?&rsquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>By this time is was no longer difficult to talk to her.&nbsp;
He told her continuously the story of his last days at
Halesby.&nbsp; She listened eagerly, putting in from time to time
a short question for which he could see no reason.&nbsp; He told
her of John Fellows&rsquo;s bouts of drink, of the way in which
he had set himself to work through his compensation money, of the
day of Dulston Wakes, the boxing booth, the brooch, the moment
when he had come blundering down into the kitchen at
Alice&rsquo;s cry for help, the struggle&mdash;and the blow with
which he had knocked his father out.&nbsp; He even told her of
the sovereigns that Alice had slipped into his pocket when he
left her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I sent back to her in that
letter,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was that all?&nbsp; It was good of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was silent, and she pressed him again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go before?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why did you stay on there till that happened?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dunno&rsquo;,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon
I&rsquo;d got to see it through.&nbsp; That football business
turned me up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You wanted to go before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I was pretty well sick of it.&nbsp; Any one would
have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>She
looked at him, and her eyes were now humble.&nbsp; She spoke
almost with diffidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if ever you want to go
from here for any reason, no matter what it is, promise me that
you&rsquo;ll tell me straight.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you keep it
hidden like that, feeling that the children and me are a drag on
you!&nbsp; If you want to go to-morrow, you go.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you think of what you said to George.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t owe
him anything.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t owe me anything at all.&nbsp;
If ever you feel for one minute you want to go, please tell me
straight.&nbsp; I can look after myself, and I shall
understand.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I felt with George.&nbsp;
Promise me. . .&rsquo;&nbsp; She leaned toward him with clasped,
beseeching hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you right enough,&rsquo; he said
awkwardly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret yourself about
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sighed, and pushed her hair back from her forehead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I feel easier,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
late it is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She wished him good-night, and left him; but he did not move
till the logs collapsed in the grate.&nbsp; He was thinking
drowsily of the other Christmas in Halesby, of the different way
in which Alice had approached him, how she had tried to draw him
nearer to her and how he had resisted her.&nbsp; He thought of
the clinging dependence of Alice contrasted with the strength and
independence of this other woman.&nbsp; Poor Alice!&nbsp; She had
never answered his letter or acknowledged his postal order; but
then, she was never one for letter-writing.&nbsp; The suggestion
of freedom, the open way of escape which Mary, in her pride, had
shown him, made him feel for a moment curious about that other
life that had seemed so far away.&nbsp; If he wanted to do so, he
reflected, he could throw up his job at a week&rsquo;s notice and
take a train that would transport him in half a day back to North
Bromwich, back to the familiar smoke-pale sky, to the chimney
stacks, the furnaces and the smell of pit mounds.&nbsp; The odour
of coal-dust and slag-heaps was in his nostrils.&nbsp; He saw the
packed amphitheatre of the Albion ground and the white-lined turf
within it.&nbsp; He heard the rumour of a football crowd, the
thud of the ball, the referee&rsquo;s whistle.&nbsp; <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>So utterly
remote. . . .&nbsp; He went to the door and opened it before he
turned the key in its wards.&nbsp; He saw nothing but the high
blackness of the winter night, not even a single star.&nbsp; The
dank air chilled him; it crept into the lighted room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a rum go . . . a bloody rum go!&rsquo; he
said, yawning.</p>
<p>With the New Year, Abner&rsquo;s work on the pipe-track became
more strenuous, for much time had been lost in the ten days of
snow that fell about the time of Bastard&rsquo;s death and in the
violent floods that followed on the thaw.&nbsp; A mild January
did little to dry the sodden workings, and the task of shovelling
earth was heavier to Abner than his old labours in Mawne
Pit.&nbsp; His mate, Munn, who lodged miserably in a leaky
labourer&rsquo;s cottage on the river-bank at Mainstone, was
taken ill with bronchitis, and Abner worked alone.&nbsp; Up to
his ankles in reddish clay he toiled, his hands were rufous and
his trousers caked with it.&nbsp; The burden of the wet earth
weighed on him.&nbsp; It was like a sullen enemy that made his
feet leaden and strained against the muscles of his arms.&nbsp;
All the labourers felt it.&nbsp; Their speech, which had been gay
and good-humoured, became dogged and irritable.&nbsp; Nor were
they the only folk who suffered.&nbsp; In every farm of the
sodden Wolfpits valley men were making the same struggle under
the raw and steely sky.&nbsp; Brimming dykes that drained the
meadows shone cold beside the black hedgerows.&nbsp; The Folly
Brook, a brown torrent, dammed with broken branches that gathered
leaves and creamy foam, filled the whole valley with melancholy
roaring.&nbsp; Waterfowl, snipe, and mallard and even slow-winged
herons, moved upward to the sodden springs.&nbsp; It was a sad
season in which the solitary workers on the farms, seen at
evening in the fields, looked as if they were stuck fast in mires
from which they could not escape: so slowly they moved, so
huddled and pitiful they seemed.&nbsp; Even on the drive at
Wolfpits, where the gravel was reasonably dry, it was painful to
see the bowed figure of old Drew returning at night, his boots so
caked with mud that he could scarcely drag himself along.&nbsp;
It was no wonder that the man found consolation <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>in the
sweet, fiery spirits that he distilled.&nbsp; He sang so loudly
at night that Mrs Mamble would come in and sit with Mary and
Abner rather than listen to his high, cracked voice.</p>
<p>Toward the end of January the vicar of the parish awoke to the
fact that George Malpas was in prison and his wife presumably
destitute.&nbsp; Between his vicarage and Wolfpits lay the vast
bulk of Castel Ditches, so that he rarely visited the valley in
winter.&nbsp; George Malpas, too, was a member of a dissenting
family, his mother being known as a fanatic Methodist; but the
Condovers, in so far as they had ever professed religion, were
church people.&nbsp; Morgan and Gladys had both been baptized in
the parish church, and since scandal informed him that old Mrs
Malpas, like the dissenter that she was, had abandoned her
son&rsquo;s family, the vicar sent the parish relieving officer
on a special visit to Wolfpits to see if Mary were starving.</p>
<p>It pained and astonished the vicar to learn that she was doing
nothing of the sort.&nbsp; She was not even humble, as a woman in
her degrading position should be.&nbsp; The relieving officer,
who had made his long journey to Wolfpits for nothing, reported
that she was not in need of relief, and for the most shameful of
reasons.&nbsp; There was a lodger, a young man employed on the
water-works and known to the police as a desperate character, who
appeared to be filling the absent husband&rsquo;s place.&nbsp;
Malpas&rsquo;s wife had not even made any decent attempt to
conceal this state of affairs.&nbsp; She had confessed brazenly
that she was living on this young man&rsquo;s earnings.&nbsp; To
help her in any way would merely be putting a premium on
immorality.&nbsp; The vicar nodded his head gravely.&nbsp; Such
cases were all too frequent in rural districts, and yet it was a
relief to feel that his principles freed him from any further
responsibility.&nbsp; He mentioned the matter with satisfaction
to his wife at supper on Sunday.&nbsp; At this meal, his weekly
labours being ended, he always felt that he could speak more
lightly of parish matters.</p>
<p>The vicar&rsquo;s wife was shocked.&nbsp; &lsquo;I always
thought her such a superior young woman, dear.&nbsp; Do have some
more beef!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; The idea of the superior and <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>desirable
young woman, whom she remembered as the mother of those two sweet
children, living in open sin, obsessed her.&nbsp; It was a
terrible and fascinating picture, and since the usual supply of
gossip failed at the next Lesswardine working party, she dilated,
in hushed tones, on the latest enormity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One feels a thing like that in one&rsquo;s own
parish,&rsquo; she said, speaking, as usual, as if she, and not
the vicar, were the incumbent.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I am afraid
nothing can be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somebody made a suggestion.&nbsp; The sister of the vicar of
Aston-by-Lesswardine, Mr Cyril Malpas&mdash;the name was a
curious coincidence&mdash;was shortly to be married to a young
engineer, and the vicar would consequently be in need of a
housekeeper.&nbsp; What a providential escape it would be if this
young woman could find a home in Mr Malpas&rsquo;s
vicarage!&nbsp; &lsquo;If only Mr Malpas would overlook this
terrible state of affairs and take her,&rsquo; they added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only difficulty that I see,&rsquo; said the
vicar&rsquo;s wife, &lsquo;is that of the children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the matron at the workhouse is so motherly, and
such a religious woman.&nbsp; Poor little things!&nbsp; It would
be a blessing in disguise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Malpas readily consented.&nbsp; His sister Celia, to tell
the truth, had not been very successful as a housekeeper.&nbsp;
Her individuality had been too marked&mdash;not to say
aggressive&mdash;for that position, and a woman who had her
reputation to regain would surely be anxious to please.</p>
<p>The new arrangement was proposed to Mary.&nbsp; The
vicar&rsquo;s wife put the matter delicately, for she prided
herself on her tact.&nbsp; More than ever she was impressed with
the young woman&rsquo;s superiority and the sweetness of the
children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I shall tell Mr Malpas that you will be glad to
come, Mrs . . . er . . . Malpas?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must talk it over with Mr Fellows,&rsquo; said
Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Fellows?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lodger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh . . . yes, I see . . .&rsquo; said the vicar&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; That evening Abner came in tired from a day&rsquo;s
work in the rain.&nbsp; His clothes were soaked; they steamed as
<a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>he stood
before the fire and filled the room with a harsh odour of wool
and sweat.&nbsp; She told him calmly of her visitor and of the
proposal that she had made.&nbsp; She did not say a word of her
own inclinations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about the kids?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take them with me.&nbsp; They would go
to the workhouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To hell with the work&rsquo;us!&rsquo; said
Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not likely!&nbsp; What do they take you
for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary smiled.&nbsp; She told him what they took her for.</p>
<p>Abner was seized with rage.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;re a dirty
lot of swine, that&rsquo;s what they are!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;By God, I&rsquo;d like to tell &rsquo;em of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s natural,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
looks like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what the hell does it matter what it looks like, so
long as there bain&rsquo;t nothing wrong?&nbsp; Old George knows
it&rsquo;s all right, and he&rsquo;m the only one as
matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the difference you being here
with me or living alone with that there parson?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a clergyman,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A clergyman, is he?&rsquo; Abner cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
clergyman!&nbsp; I like that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It pleased her, in her heart, to see him so moved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rsquo; she said
quietly.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you want to go, like you did before when
you were at home, this is your chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stood scowling in front of the fire.&nbsp; He
couldn&rsquo;t make her out.&nbsp; When he left the court at
Shrewsbury he had set himself to a deliberate line of conduct and
determined to go through with it.&nbsp; When they had spoken of
it before it had seemed to him that he and Mary were agreed on it
and that nothing could change it until George&rsquo;s
return.&nbsp; Even now he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to believe
that she wanted to make a change.&nbsp; He knew her quiet passion
for the children too well to think that anything could tempt her
to abandon them to the care of strangers.&nbsp; Also he knew her
pride.&nbsp; He believed that her pride and nothing else was
keeping her from telling him exactly what she felt.&nbsp; It was
useless for her to pretend to him that she had no feelings.&nbsp;
It struck him that she was not playing the game.&nbsp; When <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>a man and
woman were placed in their position anything but the most
complete confidence in each other was unfair.&nbsp; He would
force her to say what she thought.&nbsp; Even if it humbled her
he would force her to speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s naught to do with me,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you want to go, you go, and that&rsquo;s all that
matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was silent for a long time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you want to go, you go,&rsquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>At last she spoke, very quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>A feeling of joy swept over him, a curious, almost physical
exultation.&nbsp; He had brutally broken through the veil in
which she hid herself.&nbsp; He had seen herself at last.&nbsp;
Now, with the blood tingling in his fingers, he would assert
himself triumphantly as the man by whose labour she lived.&nbsp;
She could despise him no longer.&nbsp; He wanted to tell her so,
to make himself strong before her, but when he looked at her and
saw her humility, he could do nothing.&nbsp; His words withered
on his lips.&nbsp; He scarcely knew what he was saying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give us a spot of tea, then,&rsquo; he said roughly,
and she turned from him without another word.</p>
<h2><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>The
Seventeenth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">She</span> stayed at Wolfpits.&nbsp; The
iron of winter lay heavy on the land.&nbsp; The hills were
leagued with winter to hem them in and isolate them.&nbsp; It was
as though Wolfpits were besieged.&nbsp; For many years there had
been no such winter in the Powys march, and old men who divined
portents of weather from the berries of holly and the conduct of
birds, foretold that there was worse to come.&nbsp; By the end of
January the cloggers, as sensitive to sky-change as any feathered
migrants, had struck their tents in the Wolfpits valley, leaving
half their harvest of alder ungathered, and set off north for
Lancashire where, in a country parched with fire and warmed with
millions of huddled houses, they might finish the shaping of
their wood for market.&nbsp; In any case they had stayed in the
country later than usual, and when old Mrs Malpas, shocked by
Wigan Joe&rsquo;s attempts to put life into her husband, bundled
them out of their lodging at the Buffalo, they had no choice but
to go, for the tenting that flapped miserably by the banks of the
Folly Brook was no shelter for men in that bitter weather.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll be back to hear the cuckoo, lad,&rsquo;
said Wigan Joe.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll none get rid of bad
pennies like uz.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Abner, walking down the valley
to work, heard no longer the echoing of their axes nor the crack
of rending wood.&nbsp; Where the trim piles of billets had stood
covered in tarpaulin he now saw nothing but squares of withered
grass, and charred circles where they had made their fires among
the birches by the river.&nbsp; Their departure made Wolfpits
seem more distant and desolate than ever.&nbsp; Little by little
the constriction of winter was crushing all life out of the
valley.&nbsp; Only Wolfpits was alive, and it seemed a miracle
that even Wolfpits should live.</p>
<p>For a few days at the latter end of February there came a
mockery of sunshine, sad, like the suns of autumn.&nbsp; Abner
sang as he walked down the valley; <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>the labourers sang at their
work.&nbsp; In a moment, such is the indomitable hope of living
things, the birds broke their silence, the purple hedges were
flushed, the bare twigs of hazel trembled as though they would
shake their pale catkins out; one could feel the sap of life
secretly stirring.&nbsp; But on the third day March came in
howling like a lion with a dry wind from the northwest, sweeping
brown leaves along, and the branches of the trees that bowed
before it rattled dryly like dead bones.&nbsp; Once more the
floods arose and drowned the land, and there was no more thought
of spring.</p>
<p>Through all this season the excavations under Callow Hill went
on, and this was fortunate for Mary and her children, since
Abner&rsquo;s wages came in steadily through many weeks when snow
and flood made it impossible for men to work on the farms.&nbsp;
Sometimes old Drew would be weatherbound at Wolfpits for two days
at a time, and this was a misery to him, for he had no life but
his work, and his employer knew better than to pay him for
anything less than he performed.&nbsp; On these days he would
shut himself up in his rooms leading the life of a hibernating
animal, lighting no fire and cooking no food, simply lying
wrapped up in the blankets on his bed with door and windows
closed against the cold.&nbsp; At night he would drink himself
warm with his turnip-wine, and keep Mrs Mamble awake by
singing.</p>
<p>Fair or foul, the work of the pipe-track never slackened, and
Mary was kept busy scraping the caked mud from Abner&rsquo;s
clothes.&nbsp; The rain ceased and the floods fell.&nbsp; There
followed a hushed season in which the note of the chiff-chaff was
heard sounding faintly, timorously.&nbsp; The trees whispered
together in the night.&nbsp; The valley was silent, and yet,
beneath the silence, one felt a secret battle of blind
forces.&nbsp; Moment by moment, cell by cell, the creatures of
earth were breaking free from the heavy lethargy that had sealed
them.&nbsp; Even in the dull members of men the slow flame
quickened, the numb fibres stirred.&nbsp; As yet on the surface
of the earth few changes might be seen.&nbsp; Over the fields
flights of peewits wheeled and screamed, with flapping, tumbling
wings.&nbsp; Only the bloom of purple on the hedgerows flushed to
a warmer brown, only <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>tassels of elm-blossom in bud
softened the stark outline of their branches: only, on the fringe
of the woodland, the green of dog-mercury appeared.</p>
<p>Then, with a sudden fervour unknown in more temperate climes,
spring came.&nbsp; The sloes were sprayed with light; the hue of
hawthorn twigs paled; in the space of a single week the whole
earth broke in a green flame.&nbsp; Nor was it only green things
that were born.&nbsp; White lambs appeared as by magic in the
fields, seeming as little dependent on the agency of men as the
white daisies.&nbsp; At evening, when Abner came home from work,
they leapt into the air and twisted their heads sideways in the
leap.&nbsp; The valley was full of tender bleatings.&nbsp; He
laughed at them, striding homewards.&nbsp; His mates laughed and
whistled at their work.&nbsp; Even the sad, disfigured face of
Munn grew blandly, childishly happy.</p>
<p>Gladys and Morgan knew that spring had come&mdash;indeed they
had known of its coming long before Abner suspected it.&nbsp;
They made great plans to go out into the fields with Spider and
see the lambs at play; they cried when bedtime came, for very
excess of life.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it ban&rsquo;t dark, mam,&rsquo;
they said, coaxing Mary to let them play a little longer.&nbsp;
She could not refuse them, for she herself loved to sit sewing in
the doorway, hearing their voices echoed from the warming walls
of the house while the swallows darted to and fro under the eaves
above her.&nbsp; She would sit there talking lazily to old Drew,
who now began to be busy with his garden.&nbsp; When she inquired
how his rheumatism was, he would straighten his back with a
smile, and tell her that he felt like a man of thirty.&nbsp; When
rain came he would stand on his step gazing at the garden fondly,
as though he expected to see his seeds pushing above the
finely-tilled soil.</p>
<p>During all these days they heard nothing of George.&nbsp; The
three months of silence that the law imposes on a prisoner in
jail were now over.&nbsp; Mick Connor, that specialist in all the
details of a criminal&rsquo;s life, informed Abner that when this
time was over, the convict was usually allowed the privilege of
writing one letter a month, and, if his conduct were good enough,
he might <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>even receive one visitor of his choice.&nbsp; But no
letter came to Wolfpits.&nbsp; One day at his work Abner
overheard a conversation between two of his mates from which he
gathered that Mrs Malpas had made a journey to Shrewsbury and
seen her son.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s looking up fine, by all
accounts,&rsquo; said one of them, &lsquo;and the old
woman&rsquo;s pleased as anything he hasn&rsquo;t sent for his
missus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner experienced a sudden feeling of anger for Mary&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; He felt the slight almost as much as if it had been
pointed against himself; but on the way home he decided that it
would be better not to tell her.&nbsp; Probably she imagined that
a prisoner was shut off from all communication with the outer
world for the term of his sentence; and, if this were so, it was
better that she should remain in ignorance.&nbsp; Who would be
George&rsquo;s next visitor?&nbsp; The woman from
Lesswardine?</p>
<p>A drowsiness fell on the valley, a deep drowsiness of growth
and heavy green.&nbsp; Cuckoos began to call at dawn: even in the
heat of the day they called, flying from hedge to hedge.&nbsp;
The monotony of their song lulled the valley to sleep.&nbsp;
Twilights lengthened.&nbsp; Abner was now so settled in his life
at Wolfpits that his friends would come up and see him there,
sitting in the garden through the evening, talking to him and
playing with the children.&nbsp; Munn, who had never yet shaken
himself free from the toils of his unhappy childhood, came shyly,
and was self-conscious in their company, particularly when Mary
joined them; but Mick Connor, who had never been shy in his life
and loved children, as most Irishmen do, made his visit to
Wolfpits almost a daily custom.&nbsp; In this happy, languid
season, he had no more serious business in hand.&nbsp; He even
viewed Badger indulgently.&nbsp; Badger might shoot as many
foxes, might hatch, rear, and put down as many young pheasants in
the woods as he liked&mdash;the more the better!&nbsp; For the
present Mick was content to take his ease.</p>
<p>Mary liked him . . . she couldn&rsquo;t help liking him, for
he made her laugh, and was so kind to the children.&nbsp; Morgan,
in particular, looked forward to Mick&rsquo;s coming, for his
young animal instinct had discovered that the poacher&rsquo;s
pocket in the skirts of the Irishman&rsquo;s coat sometimes
contained bananas, a fruit to which <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Morgan would devote himself to the
degree of suffering.&nbsp; Mick could never make Gladys forsake
her Abner&rsquo;s knee for his; but Morgan&rsquo;s stomach always
got the better of filial love when his new friend appeared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there aught in your pocket, Mis&rsquo;r Connor,
to-night?&rsquo; he would say coaxingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Morgan, you mustn&rsquo;t be rude!&rsquo; Mary would
protest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I ask him, mam?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mick would wink at him: &lsquo;And how would I know
what&rsquo;s in there?&nbsp; Come and be looking, for
yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp; He would take Morgan up on his knee and
then, half awed by warnings that something might bite him, the
child would slip his hand into the deep pocket and pull out the
fruit with a chuckle of delight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Connor spoils you, and that&rsquo;s the
truth!&rsquo; Mary would reply.</p>
<p>Sometimes the pocket was empty, and at such times Mick was put
to an elaborate explanation of what had happened, embracing the
origin of this mysterious fruit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Last night, when I looked in my box where the
leprechaun puts it, there was a beautiful lot of fruit
there.&nbsp; Oranges and grapes and apples and the rest,
more&rsquo;n I could lift in the both of my hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not any bananas?&rsquo; Morgan asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bananners?&nbsp; Ah, don&rsquo;t be talkun!&nbsp; Three
beautiful bunches of them fresh from the tree, with the juice
runnun&rsquo; out of the stalks of them, they was that
ripe.&nbsp; &ldquo;So,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put them
all in my pocket, I will, and go out and ate one or two of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice sank to an awed, confidential
level.&nbsp; &lsquo;So, when I was after leaving Mainstone, and
got out on the turnpike, I walked quick along the cemetery wall,
for you never know what you mightn&rsquo;t see in a place the
likes of that.&nbsp; An&rsquo; then I heard a sound of wheels
behind me and the hoofs of horses trottun&rsquo; up to the
corner.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I thought, &ldquo;Who would be driving
after me at that time of night, an&rsquo; not a star
showun&rsquo;.&nbsp; Houly saints, I thought, what can it
be?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what it was,&rsquo; said Morgan grimly, for he
had heard of this adventure before.</p>
<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>&lsquo;Is that a fact?&rsquo; said Mick, with
impressive surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the dead-coach, mam,&rsquo; said Morgan in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so it was,&rsquo; replied Mick, slapping his
thigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;The dead-coach&mdash;and on the box of ut two
men in long black coats with the faces blacked on them and hair
like our ass.&nbsp; When they see me they pulls up sudden, and
these black pair jumps off of the box and takes hould on me and
puts their hands in my pocket, the way my shirt stuck to my back
for fright, and stole all the fruit on me and drove off without a
word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sensation of this adventure was almost enough to
compensate Morgan for the loss of his fruit.&nbsp; It was
Morgan&rsquo;s favourite story.&nbsp; But Gladys was
Abner&rsquo;s girl, and would rather sit on his knee listening
with wide eyes.&nbsp; On Abner&rsquo;s knee she felt quite
safe.</p>
<p>Sometimes Abner, Mick, and the two children would leave Mary
busy with her sewing and walk down together to the bridge over
the Folly Brook, or to the meadows where thickets of hazel and
shy companies of birches stood along the stream.&nbsp; Mick
always carried a catapult with him.&nbsp; Ever since his boyhood
he had been a deadly shot with this weapon, and could
&lsquo;knock the head off of a wran,&rsquo; as he put it, at a
range of thirty yards.&nbsp; He made Morgan a catapult with which
the child blackened his thumb-nails, and carried in his pocket
small round pebbles that he picked from the bed of the stream,
now shrunken to a thread of gin-clear water.</p>
<p>Although he could never resist killing birds when he had the
chance, Mick loved every feather on them, and indeed he knew them
well: their nestings, their flight, their song, and their quick
cries of alarm.&nbsp; He showed Morgan all the birds of that
mountain valley: the tree pipits that sprang upward like a stone
tossed into the air and then planed downwards with spread tails
twittering like mechanical toys: the sandpipers that called
plaintively from spits of sand: the black dippers that fled
upstream under the arching alders; the water-ouzel that made in
echoing, stony combes a noise that he imitated by tapping two
pebbles together: the redstarts that fluttered their bright tails
near the <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>walls in whose crevices they nested.&nbsp; And they
would stand still, this little group of four, listening to the
warble of the blackcap safely hidden in impenetrable thickets, or
lift their heads, under the high shade of larches to hear the
hissing note of the wood-wren, coming home tired in the twilight,
the children&rsquo;s hands hot with the green smell of moth-like
cuckoo-flowers that they had gathered in the meadows.</p>
<p>While the light faded the two men would smoke their pipes on
the bridge, where the big black trout that inhabited the pool
hung gorged with mayfly and held the stream with faintly
quivering fins.&nbsp; Mick loved to watch them quietly, telling,
in his slow, hypnotic tones, of the great cannibal trout of the
Barrow, so strong that they could pull a child into the water
after them.&nbsp; When they turned to go home Morgan would beg to
shoot at the trout with his catapult.&nbsp; He never hit one, but
when the stone reached the water they could see the dark streaks
of the fishes vanishing under the shadows of the bridge.</p>
<p>Often Mick would talk of great days in Ireland, the days of
country race-meetings and fairs, and round these events also a
legend arose.&nbsp; When Morgan was shooting with his catapult
the Irishman would encourage him with the patter of the man who
kept a shooting gallery, reeling off long strings of words that
meant nothing to the child, and standing up with bright eyes and
flushed cheeks as though the hum of the fair were still in his
ears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now then, walk up, walk up. . . .&nbsp; Fire, my
rattler, fire!&nbsp; Six more shots a penny!&nbsp; Right through
the hardware shop&mdash;and very near winning the silver
cane!&nbsp; Fire, my bold American, fire.&nbsp; Pass along to the
next caravan: your halfpenny is no more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told them of the maggie-man, a live Aunt Sally, who stood
up in his tub with tangled hair and fierce beard warding off the
flights of sticks that were hurled at his head, and of that great
mystery, the Live Lion Stuffed with Straw.&nbsp; Morgan drank it
all in eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why bain&rsquo;t there no fairs in these parts?&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>In a weak moment his mother told him that there were fairs in
Shropshire, and above all, the great fair <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>of Brampton
Bryan, held every year in June.&nbsp; She told him how her father
had taken her there many years ago, when she was a little girl,
and how she had eaten the cakes which are made on purpose for
this festival.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bron cakes, they call them,&rsquo;
she said.</p>
<p>The fact that eating was added to these other delights
inflamed Morgan&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will they have Bron cakes this time?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course they will.&nbsp; They always have Bron
cakes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t we go, mam?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a long way away,&rsquo; she told him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But granfer took <i>you</i> . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Granfer had a horse and trap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Grandma Malpas has a pony,&rsquo; Morgan persisted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some day, when you&rsquo;re a big boy, you shall
go,&rsquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>The subject dropped from their conversation, but not from
Morgan&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; The child knew better than to pester
his mother about it, but as the time of the fair grew nearer, he
talked to every one else that he met, to Mick, to Abner, to Mrs
Mamble, and even to old Drew.&nbsp; The thought of Bron Fair
obsessed him and even found its way into his dreams.&nbsp; The
week before the event he became so persistent and showed so keen
a disappointment at the thought of missing it, that Abner began
to take him seriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we take &rsquo;em along?&rsquo; he
said to Mary, when the children were in bed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too far away,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Much too far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that far over the hills.&nbsp; Some of
our chaps is going to walk there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t drag children up hill and down
dale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the train from
Llandwlas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t get back the
same day,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You could put in the night at Redlake.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a station there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said nothing.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to
disappoint them,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>Her interest in the children&rsquo;s happiness was her weak
point, and in the end Abner had his way.&nbsp; He settled with
the Gunner that he should leave work early on <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>the
Thursday afternoon and return on Saturday morning.&nbsp; He met
Mary and the children on the platform at Llandwlas in the
afternoon.&nbsp; Morgan had never travelled in a train before,
and stood excitedly at the window, next to his mother.&nbsp;
Gladys sat quietly by the side of Abner, who carried the brown
paper parcel in which their clothes and provisions were
packed.&nbsp; He was not quite comfortable, for it seemed to him
even now that Mary had undertaken the expedition under
protest.&nbsp; This was unreasonable, for he had enough money to
carry them through, and it was no use going on an expedition like
this unless she were determined to enjoy it.&nbsp; But Mary was
thinking of her last journey from Llandwlas in the morning train
to Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Perhaps she was thinking also of George.</p>
<p>A fit of train-sickness put a stop to Morgan&rsquo;s
enthusiasms for a time.&nbsp; In the cool of the evening they
reached the station of Redlake, a small village which stands on a
little river that is a torrent in winter but in summer no more
than a trickle of water.&nbsp; From there a road, hung with heavy
trees, runs straight to Brampton Bryan, three or four miles
away.&nbsp; The train was crowded, and as they approached Redlake
Mary grew uneasy, for she guessed that most of the travellers
were bound for the same place and with the same purpose and began
to wonder if they could find a lodging in so small a
village.&nbsp; She whispered her fears to Abner, and they hurried
from the station into the sloping street.&nbsp; The first inn
that they came to was already full.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might get a room at the Harley Arms, if
you&rsquo;re quick,&rsquo; a flustered landlord told them.&nbsp;
They went straight on.&nbsp; Abner walked too quickly for them,
and Mary almost had to run, dragging the children behind
her.&nbsp; At the Harley Arms a fat woman eyed them
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the worst day of the whole year,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can do it.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;d come in by the next train you wouldn&rsquo;t have
found a bed in the whole of Redlake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t turn the children out,&rsquo; said
Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;The little boy&rsquo;s been sick in the
train.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s face was still patched yellow and white <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>at the
corners of the mouth.&nbsp; The landlady, against all her
intentions, softened.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor little soul!&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; She tied another knot in the string of the blue
striped apron that she wore, as though her hands must be doing
something to contribute to the general atmosphere of haste and
flurry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor little soul!&nbsp; Well, now, what can
I do?&nbsp; What with the pies and one thing and another!&nbsp;
The only thing I can do is to put the man in the front room along
with Mr Prowse at the back; but I must say I don&rsquo;t like
disturbing Mr Prowse, the number of fairs he&rsquo;s been with
me.&nbsp; Comes regular, he does . . . you can look for him like
the swallows.&nbsp; Still, he&rsquo;s a nice man: a very nice
man, and if I told him all about it I don&rsquo;t think
he&rsquo;d stand in your way.&nbsp; Come along, my
dear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The last words were addressed to Mary, whose hand Morgan was
clutching convulsively as though he still felt the train swinging
under his feet.&nbsp; They all entered a room on the left of the
doorway.&nbsp; In it were two long tables spread with coarse
linen cloths of a gleaming whiteness and laden with a series of
boiled hams crisped with golden bread-crumbs, and gigantic pies
whose crusts were of the same rich hue.&nbsp; Loaves of white
bread stood between them, and at the head of each table a leaning
tower of plates.&nbsp; At the other end of the room a barrel of
cider had been propped upon two bottle-boxes.</p>
<p>Even Morgan&rsquo;s revolted stomach could not resist the
inspiration of seeing so much food.&nbsp; In a hushed voice he
asked Mary what was inside the pies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Inside of them, my love?&rsquo; cooed the
landlady.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s bunny rabbits inside of
them, and lovely pieces of bacon in a jelly that would stand by
itself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s inside of them
soon!&rsquo;&nbsp; She laughed happily and then, tying another
knot in her apron-string, explained to Mary that the rabbit pies
of the Harley Arms were an institution on the eve of Bron
Fair.&nbsp; &lsquo;We used to make as many as thirty of
them,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but the fair&rsquo;s not what it
was in those days.&nbsp; Still, they must have their pies.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;d drop down dead if they came into the room and never
see them!&nbsp; There they are, waiting ready for them: pies and
ham and bread and cider, and they helps themselves.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>too busy to look after them.&nbsp; They takes what they
want, and pays the same whether its much or little.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the custom, you see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time the concentration of rich smells had overcome
Morgan&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want to lie down,
mam,&rsquo; he said, and Mary stopped the landlady in a flood of
reminiscence to inquire again about their room before disaster
came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, now,&rsquo; she said in a more kindly, mysterious
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
put you in Mr Prowse&rsquo;s room without asking him.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the best way.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re there,
you&rsquo;re there, and that&rsquo;s the end of it.&nbsp; You can
put the little girl on the sofa and the little boy can sleep in
between the two of you.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a fine, old-fashioned
bed.&nbsp; A family bed, as the saying is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner saw Mary go red.&nbsp; He came quickly to the
rescue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re not man and wife, missus,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not a married couple?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s different altogether,&rsquo; said the landlady, her
tone hardening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This young man only came along with me to help me with
the children,&rsquo; Mary explained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve kept this place respectable all my life, and
I don&rsquo;t intend to start anything different,&rsquo; said the
landlady severely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;d better look
somewhere else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary, half shocked, half frightened, would have taken the
children away at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come along, Abner,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; But Abner would not be beaten.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, missus,&rsquo; he said to the
landlady.&nbsp; &lsquo;If we wasn&rsquo;t respectable, we could
have took you in, and you been none the wiser.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
here looking after this young woman.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing
else between us.&nbsp; If there was I should have codded you we
was married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Abner!&rsquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>The landlady looked from one to the other of this strange
couple.&nbsp; Morgan began to whimper, and the sight of the
child&rsquo;s tiredness melted her heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better come on upstairs,&rsquo; she said to
Mary, and then, with a defiant glance at Abner: &lsquo;But the <a

will have to look out for himself.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no bed
here I can give him.&nbsp; My husband and the boys&rsquo;ll have
to sleep in the loft as it is.&nbsp; I oughtn&rsquo;t to take you
in, by rights, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never you mind me,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
won&rsquo;t hurt me to sleep rough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took Mary and the children upstairs.&nbsp; Abner stayed on
in the long room alone, listening to the busy clatter of the
house.&nbsp; The landlord, his sons, and a couple of village
girls, who had been brought in to deal with the rush of business,
went running up and down stairs and stone passages and in and out
of the bar as quickly and apparently as aimlessly as the
inhabitants of a disturbed ants&rsquo; nest.&nbsp; The sun dipped
behind the mountains.&nbsp; A train arrived from the north, then
another from the south, and each time the street was flooded with
a crowd of excitable men knocking at door after door in search of
lodging for the night.&nbsp; Abner heard the landlord in the bar
refusing them one after another.&nbsp; With the second train
arrived the important Mr Prowse, a tall, lumbering man in cord
breeches and black leggings covered with the red dust of the
Black Mountain, from the slopes of which he came.&nbsp; He wore a
close red beard, and spoke in a high sing-song, for part of his
mountain pasturage was in Wales.&nbsp; He had already drunk too
freely at the Craven Arms station buffet to be much worried by
the idea of a sleeping companion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it you&rsquo;re after this fair, Mr
Prowse?&rsquo; asked the landlord.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Draught horses,&rsquo; said the farmer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They&rsquo;re very scarce down our way, and a price that
would frighten you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you and me are going to have a field day, Mr
Prowse,&rsquo; said a fat, asthmatical Cardiff Jew, who had just
arrived in the doorway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Mr Myers, how is it then?&rsquo; said the
farmer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr May says he&rsquo;s put you and me to
sleep in the same room.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a young woman in the
front.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A young woman?&rsquo; growled Myers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a young woman doing here at this
time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The more of them the better!&rsquo; said the farmer,
with a laugh.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>&lsquo;No. . . .&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got over all
that,&rsquo; said the Jew, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, what are you two gentlemen taking with me?&rsquo;
asked the landlord.</p>
<p>They all settled down to talk about horses.&nbsp; Abner was
getting more and more hungry and wondering when Mary would come
downstairs.&nbsp; The sight of that magnificent array of food
whetted his appetite, but he did not want to be the first to
begin.&nbsp; He drew himself a mug of cider from the cask: a dry,
half bitter product of the Hereford orchards.&nbsp; He drank a
pint of it, and the alcohol, taken on an empty stomach, made him
happy and confident.&nbsp; He no longer felt uneasy that Mary was
so long away.</p>
<p>Now he had not long to wait for his supper, for Prowse and
Myers came in from the bar, and in a few moments other men
arrived.&nbsp; They all carved for themselves huge segments of
pie and rich slices of ham with knives that were whetted thin
with use.&nbsp; Abner took his place among them.&nbsp; Nobody
spoke to him, for he seemed to be the only stranger in the
company.&nbsp; Many of them had not seen their friends for a
whole year, since their last meeting in the same place.&nbsp;
Twilight came, and the lamps were lit.&nbsp; The buyers sat on
talking and drinking at the tables, running with one accord to
door or window when the hoofs of some horse that had been brought
to the fair for sale were heard trotting down the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jenkins wants to sell that there cob to-night rather
than take him to Bron,&rsquo; said Myers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never buy a horse you don&rsquo;t see by
daylight,&rsquo; Prowse replied, shaking his clay pipe to mark
the words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Myers, with a wink.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I heard a fellow from Brum offer him forty, and he&rsquo;s
a fool if he don&rsquo;t take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s high prices going this fair,&rsquo; said
Prowse.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a great scarcity down our
way.&nbsp; Jenkins is a chap as knows his business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so do I,&rsquo; said the Jew.&nbsp; &lsquo;So do
I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner, mildly exalted, walked out into the moonlit
street.&nbsp; At the cottage doors and down by the bridge little
groups of men in breeches and leggings stood <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>talking
together with low voices.&nbsp; From time to time the clatter of
approaching hoofs was heard and the men stopped to listen.&nbsp;
The village was full of a strange sense of expectancy.&nbsp;
Abner wandered over the bridge and a little way upstream.&nbsp;
In the hush of the night he heard a girl laughing.&nbsp; The
sound disturbed him.&nbsp; He thought suddenly of Susie.&nbsp;
The excitement of drink and a full stomach turned his thoughts in
the direction of physical desire.&nbsp; He stopped and listened
for the girl&rsquo;s voice again, and wondered what man was with
her.</p>
<p>He walked back irritably into the village.&nbsp; An old man
was putting out the oil lamps that gave a feeble light to the
street.&nbsp; What was he, Abner, doing without a woman, when the
village was full of them?&nbsp; He looked up at the front room of
the inn where Mary and the children were sleeping.&nbsp; It
filled him with an unreasoning annoyance to think of her sleeping
calmly there.&nbsp; She was treating him ridiculously, without
confidence.&nbsp; Why hadn&rsquo;t she come down into the room
for supper as soon as she had put the children to sleep?&nbsp;
Just because the landlady had shocked her by suggesting that they
should sleep together, he supposed, and, by God, it might have
put some sense into her if they had done so.&nbsp; He
laughed.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t thought of Mary in that light
before; but in this curious state to which the liquor, the
moonlight, and that light voice heard in the darkness had excited
him, he felt that he had been a fool not to make love to
Mary.&nbsp; If once he had treated her that way and she had
accepted him, there would be an end of her airs and graces.&nbsp;
George . . .?&nbsp; Well, George&rsquo;s own life didn&rsquo;t
exact a high degree of fidelity from his wife.</p>
<p>So, like a hungry animal, Abner prowled beneath the inn
windows.&nbsp; The panes of that which belonged to Mary&rsquo;s
bedroom shone blankly in the moon through twigs of white
jessamine.&nbsp; In the bar, Mr Prowse, now very drunk, was
declaiming staccato judgments on the value of basic slag.&nbsp;
Abner would have joined them and got drunk if he had any money to
spend, but the small sum that he had saved for the occasion would
<a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>do no
more than pay for their lodging and their return fares to
Llandwlas.&nbsp; The moonlight seemed to cool the air.&nbsp; Even
the smell of jessamine grew fainter in the cold.&nbsp; It was no
good standing there any longer, and so he found a sleeping place
on some straw in the loft above the stable, and settled down as
well as he could, listening to the steady grinding of the
horses&rsquo; jaws and the snatching noise that they made as they
pulled out hay from the racks above their mangers.</p>
<p>Mary slept badly.&nbsp; Earlier in the evening, when Morgan
and Gladys had fallen asleep, she had caught the landlady on the
stairs and begged that her supper might be brought to her in her
bedroom.&nbsp; There she had devoured a solitary plate of the
famous rabbit-pie, but hearing below her the sound of many
men&rsquo;s voices and still dreading to be mistaken for
Abner&rsquo;s wife, she had not dared to go downstairs and find
him.&nbsp; Instead of thinking any more about it she decided to
go to bed, creeping gently under the sheets for fear of
disturbing the children.&nbsp; But she could not sleep.&nbsp; The
bedroom was immediately over the room in which supper was served,
and she could not hear so many voices buzzing beneath her without
wanting to catch what they were saying.&nbsp; As the evening wore
on the house grew noisier.&nbsp; It seemed as if they would never
go to bed; and when, at last, the noise ceased and she had nearly
fallen asleep, the moonlight, beating in through the
muslin-curtained window, awoke Morgan.&nbsp; He said that he was
thirsty, and after much groping, she gave him water from the ewer
on the washhand-stand.&nbsp; Thus awakened from the sleep that
followed his train-sickness, the excitement of his strange
surroundings kept him going for a couple of hours of questions
about the fair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why bain&rsquo;t Abner up here?&rsquo; he said at
last.</p>
<p>This was more than she could explain.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you
don&rsquo;t keep quiet, my son,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I shall
take you right out and give you to Abner for the night.&nbsp;
Then you&rsquo;ll cry to come back to your mother.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re a little nuisance, that&rsquo;s what you
are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She tucked him away and huddled him against her breast away
from the moonlight, and so, at length, he fell asleep.</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>Next
morning, Abner, who had slept well, was early astir, but no
earlier, it seemed, than the rest of the world.&nbsp; In the yard
below him the owner of the stabled horses was up and grooming
them.&nbsp; He asked Abner to give him a hand and offered him a
shilling for his trouble.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon they&rsquo;m
going to make wonnerful prices to-day,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; An
opaline sky, covered with the faintest veil of mist, promised a
hot morning.</p>
<p>The landlord of the Harley Arms had not yet risen, but the
girls were sweeping the passage and setting the table for
breakfast in the long room, and his wife was watching them with
sleepy eyes, while she sipped a cup of tea.&nbsp; Abner joined
her, paid the bill for the night, five shillings, and took some
tea with bread and butter to the door of Mary&rsquo;s room.&nbsp;
He knocked and called to her, and she answered in a voice that
seemed alarmed by his nearness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I bain&rsquo;t going to eat you <i>nor</i> the
children,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a
fine day.&nbsp; How long do you want to keep us
waiting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She assured him timidly that they wouldn&rsquo;t be long, and
by half-past nine they had become part of the stream of traffic
flowing along the road from Redlake to Brampton Bryan, raising
clouds of hot dust under the heavy green of the trees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think the sun will come through, after
all,&rsquo; said Mary regretfully, though the sight of the horses
sweating on the road should have told her that this was
fortunate.&nbsp; They walked slowly along the edge of the white
highway, Mary anxiously pulling in the children to her side when
swift traps or single horses, southward bound, came past
them.&nbsp; It seemed to her that so great a collection of
strong, spirited animals, which snorted and sniffed the air
excited by the presence of strangers of their kind, was
dangerous.&nbsp; What would happen to Morgan and Gladys if some
sudden noise or infectious fear threw them into a stampede?&nbsp;
All the way along the road she was looking anxiously ahead for
the next gateway or gap in the hedge, planning ways of
escape.</p>
<p>The children loitered, and it was nearly noon when they
reached the outskirts of Brampton Bryan.&nbsp; The <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>sky was
still white.&nbsp; Mist lay cold on the hills, but the plain grew
suffocating.&nbsp; At this point, where the traffic began to feel
the backward pressure of the congested village, matters were
complicated by an actual constriction of the road.&nbsp; Horses
and traps were crowded together in a block, and the men who drove
them looked serious and impatient.&nbsp; There was scarcely room
along the side of the road for them to pass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you
waiting for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t we wait here till they move on?&rsquo; said
Mary, gathering the children closer to her.&nbsp; If she could
have done so without encountering other advancing dangers she
would have turned back.&nbsp; She hated this narrow, twisting
neck of roadway.</p>
<p>They waited, leaning up against an iron fence, breathing the
hot smell of the horses.&nbsp; Other people on foot passed them
in a steady stream.&nbsp; Among these Abner saw the farmer from
the Black Mountain and his friend the lethargic Jew.&nbsp; They
appeared to be talking together, and thinking of nothing else,
but their eyes were wide open, and when they saw a likely animal
they would stop and ask the driver about prices or stoop and run
their hands along the horse&rsquo;s slender legs.&nbsp; They did
not notice Abner with Mary and the children in the hedge.&nbsp;
The block of vehicles moved on a little and was checked.&nbsp;
The movement, slight as it was, infected the animals with
restlessness.&nbsp; They snorted, and champed their bits; they
danced with springing fetlocks and necks arched to the tightened
reins.&nbsp; Mary pressed closer to the iron railings.&nbsp; She
felt that she was foolish to be scared, and yet it irritated her
to see the unconcern of Abner.&nbsp; What was his strength
compared with the violence of horses?&nbsp; Again the block moved
on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t wait here all day,&rsquo; he said; but
she only shook her head.</p>
<p>A strange cart pulled up opposite to them, drawn by a
spiritless pony and bearing a black tin plate with the words:
Hughes, Brecon, painted on it in a scrawl of white.&nbsp; A gipsy
drove it, and behind, on the tilted cart-tail sat a withered,
dirty woman and a girl of fifteen with a beautiful dark face and
long, black hair, which <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>the old woman was carefully and
necessarily combing.&nbsp; To the tail of the cart a cowed and
mangy mongrel of the greyhound breed was tied with a strand of
rope.&nbsp; The eyes of the girl were dark and wild as those of
an animal, and she stared insolently at Abner, half-smiling,
attracted, no doubt, by the contrast of his fair strength.&nbsp;
For some strange reason Mary felt that the girl&rsquo;s glance
hurt her.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s smiling at you.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t look at her, Abner!&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How dirty she is!&rsquo;&nbsp; The whisper disturbed the
old woman, who ceased her hairdressing, wiped the comb on her
apron and smiled across at Mary.&nbsp; She had no teeth but a
single yellow tusk in the middle of her lower jaw.&nbsp; She
leaned over the edge of the cart and held out her hand toward
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall the old woman tell your fortune, my pretty
dear?&rsquo; she whined.&nbsp; &lsquo;You and your lovely
children and your husband?&nbsp; A fine upstanding man, my dear,
if ever there was one.&nbsp; Cross the old woman&rsquo;s hand
with a bit of silver and she&rsquo;ll tell you the future as
it&rsquo;s written!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary looked away.&nbsp; The gipsy girl continued to stare at
Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t you want to know the happiness
that&rsquo;s coming?&rsquo; the old woman went on, with her hand
outstretched.&nbsp; &lsquo;I tell you that&rsquo;s worth more to
you than a piece of silver.&nbsp; All that lays before you, my
pretty dear. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary clutched at Abner&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
look at her!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s staring at you!&nbsp; I think
we&rsquo;d better go on,&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp; But a cart
had pulled in to the side in front of them, and they could not
move.&nbsp; The old woman continued to pester them with her
whinings.&nbsp; When she saw that no silver would cross her palm
she changed her tone.&nbsp; She leaned further out of her cart,
speaking now of ill-fortune rather than good, gratuitously
prophesying evil, and a near evil at that.&nbsp; Abner bandied
words with her and laughed, but Mary felt her heart sinking
within her.&nbsp; From more maledictions they were saved by a
sudden forward movement of the block.&nbsp; The cart started with
a jerk which pulled the mongrel who had been biting at fleas on
its belly, to its feet.&nbsp; The girl <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>gave Abner
a final, dark smile; the old woman spat in Mary&rsquo;s
direction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said Abner, &lsquo;now&rsquo;s your
chance!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Mary could not move.&nbsp; In some way the encounter had
destroyed her nerve.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s wait till
it&rsquo;s clearer!&rsquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>A drove of mountain ponies that the gipsies had driven down to
the fair from some heathery upland of Montgomery or Clun,
followed them.&nbsp; They were small, shaggy, and very
wild.&nbsp; They stamped and snorted, then huddled together
anxiously in a bunch, sniffing the air with distended
nostrils.&nbsp; The sense of being herded together between the
hedge and the iron railings made them tremble with fright, and
Mary was no less frightened than they.&nbsp; Her anxiety spread
to the children, and for the first time since they had left
Redlake Morgan forgot his cakes.&nbsp; He began to whimper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re all right,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you take no notice of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little black stallion, the last of the herd, suddenly took
fright.&nbsp; He made a dash for the hedge on the opposite side,
but the blackthorn was too high for him and he stood quivering
half-way up the bank.&nbsp; A heavy loutish man, of
Atwell&rsquo;s build, who seemed a giant beside the little
animal, climbed up and took hold of it by the ear.&nbsp; It gave
a sudden convulsive movement, and in a moment the man and the
horse were fighting together.&nbsp; The animal pulled him to the
ground and for a moment they struggled in the dust.&nbsp; Then
another man sat on its head and put a snitch on its muzzle.&nbsp;
They jumped aside and the pony leapt to its feet.&nbsp; It stood
trembling and screamed with pain.&nbsp; The big man, panting and
dusty, held the rope of which the snitch was made.&nbsp; A bitter
fight followed, the pony rushing wildly from side to side with
fierce, terrible screams, the man holding on grimly yet barely
keeping his feet.&nbsp; The other gipsies drove on the rest of
the herd, and those who came behind ran forward to watch the
duel, with cries of encouragement now to the man, now to the
beast.&nbsp; It was a horrible sight, at which Mary did not dare
to look, though <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>Abner enjoyed it.&nbsp; To and fro the panting animal
plunged.&nbsp; It rolled on the ground, leapt in the air, with
fierce snortings and shrill cries.&nbsp; Its eyes were bright
with rage.&nbsp; At last it stood stock still in the middle of
the road and would not move.&nbsp; The man who had sat on its
head approached it with a halter.&nbsp; Still it stood its
ground, trembling violently, shaken with angry snorts,
foaming.&nbsp; It seemed that the fight was over and the wild
spirit conquered, but before he could slip the halter on its head
the animal had taken another violent leap.&nbsp; Abner saw its
body hurling through the air and threw himself in front of Mary
and the children.&nbsp; He went over with the stallion on the top
of him, hearing Mary&rsquo;s cry.&nbsp; The iron railings were
bent back, and Mary was holding Gladys in her arms.&nbsp; The
shouts of the crowd rang in Abner&rsquo;s ears:
&lsquo;Her&rsquo;s dead!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve no business to drive
&rsquo;em on a public road!&nbsp; Savage they are!&nbsp; Poor
little thing!&nbsp; These bloody gipsies!&nbsp; That chap did his
best . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two men were now holding the pony, and the big fellow was
bending over Mary and the ghastly face of the child.&nbsp; Abner
pushed him aside.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s all right . . .
she&rsquo;s all right!&rsquo; said Mary.&nbsp; Gladys was crying
in shrill, frightened gasps.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My leg, mam, oh, my leg!&rsquo; she wailed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Try to move your toes, love,&rsquo; a woman said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If she can move her toes the bone&rsquo;s not
broken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A dozen others clustered round with various advice, while the
men stood staring stupidly with pained eyes.&nbsp; Mary was
hiding the child&rsquo;s face in her bosom.&nbsp; Morgan clung
crying to her skirts.&nbsp; Her face was terribly set, but she
soon recovered her presence of mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner . . . you take Morgan,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We must find a doctor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He lives just round the corner, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; a
bustling woman cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;The red &rsquo;ouse with the
trees in front of it.&nbsp; You can see the roof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me take her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s too heavy for
you,&rsquo; said Abner and Mary surrendered the child, picking up
Morgan in her own arms.&nbsp; A curious crowd followed them to
the doctor&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>The
Eighteenth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> found the doctor just setting
out on his morning round.&nbsp; His wife, a forbidding woman,
plainly dressed and flat-chested, caught him in the stableyard
and brought him back into the surgery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the first accident . . . a little
girl,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you ever know the fair
without one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He followed her in fussily, hoping that there was nothing to
keep him, for he had a long list of country visits to get through
before the broken heads should begin to roll up in the
evening.&nbsp; Abner had laid the child down on a high couch
covered with American leather.&nbsp; In the road she had screamed
her breath away and now she lay shivering and whimpering softly,
almost quiet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what is it?&rsquo; said the doctor brusquely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s her leg,&rsquo; Mary whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s broken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A kick from a horse,&rsquo; said the doctor&rsquo;s
wife from the background.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s fingers fumbled with the tapes of the
child&rsquo;s drawers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scissors!&rsquo; said the doctor.&nbsp; The sudden
touch of steel made Gladys cry out loud, and the first cry of
alarm was quickly changed to one of pain.&nbsp; She struggled
with the pain and by her movement increased it.&nbsp; The doctor
leaned his left arm above her body and held her still.&nbsp;
Mary, clasping Gladys&rsquo;s hands in hers, put down her face to
the child&rsquo;s tear-dabbled cheek.&nbsp; Her own tears were
mingled with those of her child, but she made no sound.&nbsp;
Abner stood helpless, watching, and behind him also stood the
doctor&rsquo;s wife, gaunt, flat, immobile.&nbsp; In a former
state she had been a sister at the North Bromwich Infirmary.</p>
<p>The doctor was leaning over Gladys and breathing heavily
through his nostrils.&nbsp; His hands, lean, brown, and slightly
stained with iodine, were placed firmly yet tenderly upon the
pink and white of the child&rsquo;s <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>thigh.&nbsp; His fingers moved like
tentacles, searching, soothing the spastic muscles under the
skin.&nbsp; Gladys gave a sudden frightened, &lsquo;Oh . . .
<i>mam</i>!&rsquo;&mdash;and the fingers tightened like bands of
steel.&nbsp; All the man&rsquo;s mind was in his fingers; his
eyes gazed vaguely out of the window to the cascades of fading
laburnum blossom in his shrubbery, the billowy outline of lilac
against the white sky.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . .&rsquo; he said at last.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Separated epiphysis.&nbsp; Lower end of femur.&nbsp; I
shall want a small Liston splint and plenty of strapping.&nbsp; I
expect she&rsquo;ll need a whiff of chloroform, too.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;ll get it I won&rsquo;t move.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he
addressed Mary.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think it will be better if the
small boy is out of the room.&nbsp; They can look after him in
the kitchen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bribed by a sup of cocoa, Morgan allowed himself to be taken
away from his mother by the doctor&rsquo;s wife, who soon
returned with the splint, the dressings, and the
an&aelig;sthetic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just get her under, if you&rsquo;ll see that
she doesn&rsquo;t move.&nbsp; If she kicks about there may be a
lot more h&aelig;morrhage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His wife took his place and he sprinkled a few drops of heavy
liquid on to a wire mask covered with lint.&nbsp; A sweetish
odour mingled with that of the lilac.&nbsp; It seemed to Abner
that the room had suddenly become oppressively hot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now breathe deeply.&nbsp; Smell it in!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
ever so nice!&rsquo; said the doctor.&nbsp; Gladys sniffed, then
choked, and tried to push away the mask with her hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold her fingers, mother!&rsquo; said the doctor.&nbsp;
Mary closed her eyes and took the child&rsquo;s fingers in her
own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s better . . . that&rsquo;s
better.&rsquo;&nbsp; He sprinkled more chloroform on the
lint.&nbsp; In another minute he raised the mask.&nbsp; Gladys
was now breathing heavily; her face was suffused, and she puffed
out her lips with each breath.&nbsp; The doctor handed over the
mask to his wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give her a drop now and
then,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and plenty of air as well.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s just nicely under.&rsquo;&nbsp; He pushed back an
eyelid with his finger to see that the pupillary reflex was
active.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nicely . . . nicely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rose to his feet and changed places with his wife.</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>Again
he placed his hands on the child&rsquo;s thigh, but now the hands
were no longer gentle agents of perception, but strong and
ruthless weapons.&nbsp; His brown fingers grasped the limb
firmly.&nbsp; The room swam before Abner&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; He
went down like a stone.&nbsp; Mary gave a cry of alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said the doctor, with a
glance over his shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;These big strong fellows
are always the most liable to faint over a job like this.&nbsp;
Give me a woman, any day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Abner came to his senses the limb was set.&nbsp; A long
splint with a serrated lower end had been strapped to the
child&rsquo;s body from armpit to heel.&nbsp; Her face was still
flushed, but she breathed as softly as though she were lying in a
natural sleep.&nbsp; The doctor was washing his hands and
preparing to set out again.&nbsp; He offered Abner a medicine
glass full of cold water with a dash of brandy in it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s owing, gaffer?&rsquo; Abner asked.</p>
<p>The doctor looked him up and down.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
labourer,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;with a wife and two kids: a
decent-looking young fellow.&rsquo;&nbsp; He hated asking those
people for money in the middle of a misfortune; but he had to
live.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll say five shillings,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;but don&rsquo;t forget to send me the splint back.&nbsp;
Dr Davies, Brampton Bryan.&nbsp; That will find me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner gave him two half-crowns that were loose in his
pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must be
careful how you carry her.&nbsp; The bone&rsquo;s in a nice
position if you don&rsquo;t disturb it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long will it take, doctor?&rsquo; Mary asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Five or six weeks with luck.&nbsp;
Good-morning!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For an hour or more they stayed in the surgery, visited from
time to time by the doctor&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Gladys awoke as
from a gentle sleep.&nbsp; The support of the splint freed her
from the spasm of the torn muscles.&nbsp; She rubbed her eyes and
cried softly in her mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d best go straight to the station,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>So, having torn the unwilling Morgan from the material
attentions of the cook, they set off along the <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>hot road
that they had travelled earlier in the day.&nbsp; They walked
slowly, for they had at least three hours to spare before the
afternoon train left Redlake station.&nbsp; They reached their
goal at three o&rsquo;clock and laid the child down flat on a
bench in the waiting room, while Abner produced the sandwiches
which he had cut earlier in the morning at the inn.&nbsp; Morgan,
having fed and cried a little because his dinner did not include
specimens of the famous Bron cakes, fell asleep upon his
mother&rsquo;s knees.&nbsp; Mary and Abner talked together in
undertones for fear of waking the children, until the
station-master entered the waiting-room with a swagger and threw
up the shutter of the booking-office, peering at them with
official eyes through the wire grille.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d better get the tickets,&rsquo; said
Abner.&nbsp; He went to the window, asking for two third singles
and two halves to Llandwlas.&nbsp; The station-master whipped the
tickets out and stamped them as smartly as though a queue of a
hundred trippers was waiting for him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Five and four
pence ha&rsquo;penny,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Abner felt for his purse: he knew that the doctor&rsquo;s fee
had only left him a few coppers loose in his pocket.&nbsp; A
panic seized him.&nbsp; He could not find it.&nbsp; He turned to
Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You got my purse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never seen it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was a quid in it.&nbsp; I must have put it in my
waistcoat.&nbsp; Wait a moment, gaffer. . . .&nbsp; God! my watch
is gone too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t get moithered now,&rsquo; she urged.</p>
<p>But though he searched everywhere he could not find it.&nbsp;
He appealed again to Mary, but she had no money, not a single
penny.&nbsp; Abner had nothing but a handful of coppers left.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must have took both of them . . . picked my
pocket!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She advised him to look again, but it was useless.&nbsp;
&lsquo;While we was standing up again&rsquo; those
railings,&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;talking to that gipsy
woman.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s gone right enough.&nbsp; Not a bloody
cent except this!&rsquo;&nbsp; He threw the coppers on the sill
of the booking window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had your pocket picked?&rsquo; said the station-master
<a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>with a
laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not the first time that&rsquo;s
happened at Bron Fair!&rsquo;&nbsp; A bell clanged in the signal
box, and a porter peered at them through the door with a stupid,
rustic face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you let us have a ticket on strap?&rsquo;
Abner asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not likely!&rsquo; said the stationmaster.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that tale before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The little girl&rsquo;s had an accident . . . broken
her leg,&rsquo; Mary pleaded.</p>
<p>The station-master shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not another train to-day,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have we time to try and get some money in the
village?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The porter gave a stupid laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Train&rsquo;s two minutes overdue now,&rsquo; said the
station-master blandly, glancing at the clock on the
booking-office wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what can we do?&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>The train clanked in.&nbsp; A number of country people in
their Sunday clothes, coming from the villages under the Long
Mynd, swarmed on to the platform.&nbsp; They came laughing into
the booking-office.&nbsp; &lsquo;All tickets!&rsquo; shouted the
porter at the door.&nbsp; Abner was still rummaging in his
pockets when the train went out.&nbsp; They were left quite
alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can we do?&rsquo; Mary repeated, in a voice full
of trouble.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to walk, that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t carry her all that way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s only eight or nine miles over the
hills.&nbsp; We can walk that easy before dark if we take our
time.&rsquo;&nbsp; She shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
Morgan,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to help Morgan on a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too much.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t carry her
all that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed at her and, in the end, persuaded her.&nbsp; By
this time Morgan, awake and refreshed, was again clamouring for
food.&nbsp; In the post-office at Redlake they bought him a
packet of acid-drops and some biscuits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s got to last you, my son,&rsquo; Mary
told him, and for the present he was satisfied.</p>
<p>They set out slowly on their journey home.&nbsp; For a <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>mile or
more the road ran along the side of the little river, but soon
the valley fell away beneath them, a deep trough clogged with
brushwood, and the road degenerated into a stony track.&nbsp; It
seemed that they had now penetrated a country that was untouched
by the excitements of Bron Fair, for whenever they came near to a
farm, and these grew fewer and fewer, being hidden for the most
part in folds of the hills and lost in sheltering trees, they
found men moving slowly about the fields or calling cattle to the
byre for the evening&rsquo;s milking.</p>
<p>Soon the distances of the landscape had faded from them
altogether.&nbsp; They came to an upland scarred with stony lanes
where they could see nothing on either side of them but thistle
pastures, poor and unkindly, huge fields where many sheep were
feeding in the mist.&nbsp; Morgan enjoyed himself, running up the
banks to a gap in the broken wall and scaring them as he stood
there like a phantom himself, waving his arms.&nbsp; At last,
when it seemed that they could climb no farther into the clouds,
the road began to fall.</p>
<p>Abner was glad of this, for, strong as he was, the weight of
Gladys, made more awkward by her long splint, was telling on
him.&nbsp; The road gave him no rest: it went on inflexibly
between its walls of stone, and when his breath failed him there
was no clean air with which he might fill his lungs: only this
thin, clammy whiteness.&nbsp; They jolted down into a valley,
where they found a village of stone houses, so cold and
mountainous in character that it seemed to have been scoured with
snow.</p>
<p>Above the door of the post-office Abner spelt out the word,
<i>Newchurch</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;New church?&rsquo; said Mary, with a sinking
heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;But Newchurch is miles and miles away from
us!&nbsp; I drove here once with father.&nbsp; Are you sure
it&rsquo;s the right road?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s right by what I heard at the Pound House,
when Mick talked of walking over to Bron.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s right
enough . . . only the hills make it seem longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little later she asked him anxiously what the time was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know my watch is gone?&rsquo; he
replied <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>irritably.&nbsp; &lsquo;By what it was in Newchurch I
reckon we&rsquo;ve a good four hour before dark.&nbsp; And then
there&rsquo;s a moon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They crossed another ridge of hills.&nbsp; Half-way up the
slope Morgan said that he was tired, and asked his mother to
carry him.&nbsp; She took him up in her arms without a word and
dragged along behind Abner.&nbsp; He looked back at her,
questioning, for the slowness of her pace impeded him.&nbsp; She
knew what he was thinking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go faster,&rsquo; she said, trying to
smile; but at the next brow she had to stop to fetch her breath,
putting Morgan down on the bank beside her under a bush of green
broom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to walk again now, mam,&rsquo; he said
cheerfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are we nearly there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had pestered her so often with this question that for a
moment her strained temper gave way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Morgan!&rsquo; she said
sharply.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when we&rsquo;re
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner laughed, and she turned on him with annoyance.&nbsp; She
thought he was laughing at her irritability, but found that his
eyes were kindly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucky for them they don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he said,
shaming her with a smile.</p>
<p>She tried to cover her annoyance by asking if they were
anywhere near the top of the hills.</p>
<p>He knew no more than she did.&nbsp; Certainly by the time that
they had rested and moved on again the fog had thickened.&nbsp;
The stone walls and the clumps of hawthorn and furze with which
the fields were scattered looked misty, wild, gigantic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Time we quickened up a bit,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you be sure it&rsquo;s the right
road?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because there bain&rsquo;t no other, missus,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Up you come, my pretty!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he
hoisted Gladys into his arms again.</p>
<p>They could no longer guess at the time of day.&nbsp; Mary
supposed that it was now getting on for six o&rsquo;clock, but
the sky that drooped upon them was of a uniform, milky whiteness,
and they could not guess the level of the sun.&nbsp; The air,
indeed, grew colder, but that was a relief in itself after the
oppression of the valleys.</p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>They
walked on, maybe for another hour.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s arms ached
with the burden of Morgan, who told her from time to time that
his legs hurt him or that he wanted to go to bye-bye, and vexed
her to the point of anger with his cry of, &lsquo;Are we nearly
there?&rsquo;&nbsp; She herself was utterly fagged and
hungry.&nbsp; Her anxiety for Gladys had made it impossible for
her even to think of food in the earlier part of the day.&nbsp;
Now her stomach ached with emptiness, and the cold, moist air
that she drew into her labouring lungs did nothing to quench the
drought in her throat.&nbsp; Morgan suddenly began to whine for a
drink of water.&nbsp; The sweets had made him thirsty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They don&rsquo;t lay on the water up here, my
son,&rsquo; said Abner cheerfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I <i>want</i> some,&rsquo; Morgan insisted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Or</i> tea,&rsquo; he added, as a slight
concession.</p>
<p>Mary quietened him as well as she could with promises.&nbsp;
They had not passed a farm or a shepherd&rsquo;s cabin for
miles.&nbsp; She could see no hope of any building ahead short of
the Wolfpits valley, not even as much as would shelter them for
the night if they lost their way or if the strength of the
weakest failed.&nbsp; They were wandering on and on, blindly, as
it seemed, into a desert of high, poor pastures.&nbsp; Now they
no longer saw large flocks of sheep.&nbsp; Those that they
startled were solitary creatures that sprang up in alarm from the
wayside tangles of furze and brier, horned mountain sheep, with
shaggy fleeces and black faces.</p>
<p>She felt that the light was failing.&nbsp; Perhaps the sun had
set.&nbsp; Surely it had set, for they had walked
endlessly.&nbsp; At sunset the birds began their song in the
thickets about Wolfpits, but here there was no shelter for
birds.&nbsp; Only the wheat-ears bobbed their white rumps in
front of them and the meadow-pipits flew before them in their
endless game of waiting and of flight, so tame that Morgan ran to
catch one with his hands.&nbsp; Out of the whiteness above them
they heard the lost bubbling voices of curlews, or the harsh
cawing of the carrion crow.</p>
<p>She dragged on behind, and Abner walked ahead, never
tiring.&nbsp; She would have died rather than have <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>complained,
as long as he made no complaint.&nbsp; A stone cottage rose up
out of the mist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you shall have your drink,&rsquo; she cried
encouragingly to Morgan.&nbsp; The sight brightened her, for she
was parched dry herself.&nbsp; But the cottage was only a ruin
with a broken gate on either side of it that had made a walled
enclosure for sheep.&nbsp; Not very long ago sheep had been
penned there, for torn fleece had stuck to the splinters of the
gates and the road was strewn with dry dung.&nbsp; Abner went up
to the door to see if by any chance they were mistaken; but the
place was quite deserted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down a bit,&rsquo; he said, and lit his
pipe.&nbsp; She sat down wearily beside him.&nbsp; Morgan,
smelling round the garden like a puppy, came back with a bunch of
wallflowers and gave them to her.&nbsp; Their scent was a poor
substitute for food, but she kissed his cold face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want a drink of water, mam,&rsquo; he said again.</p>
<p>She looked desperately at Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait till we come on a bottle of pop, son,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; Morgan stared at him with big eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Real
pop?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You wait and see,&rsquo; said Abner cheerfully.</p>
<p>Gladys, who had just begun to cry quietly in his arms, said
that she was cold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll keep you warm, my pretty!&rsquo; he said,
gathering her to his breast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are we nearly there, mam?&rsquo; came the voice of
Morgan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . . yes . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; She turned to Abner:
&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be much farther, the time we&rsquo;ve been
walking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Up she comes!&rsquo; he said,
kissing Gladys and lifting her gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your &lsquo;stache is all over water, Abner,&rsquo; the
child whispered.</p>
<p>They passed through the second gate, but here a new perplexity
faced them.&nbsp; They had come to open moorland.&nbsp; The road
that had hitherto been enclosed by stone walls was now no more
than outlined by wheel-ruts bitten deep into the peaty
soil.&nbsp; Mile upon mile of misty heather rolled away before
them.&nbsp; Then the track faded altogether, splitting into three
narrow <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>lanes between the masses of ling.&nbsp; Abner stopped,
and this, his first hesitation, filled Mary with dread.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which way is it?&rsquo; she called.</p>
<p>He could not answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;We must be somewhere near
the top,&rsquo; he said at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;Somewhere on the
far side of the Ditches.&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t for this stuff
we could see all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t see,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know any more
than I do.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you go on so quickly,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If we keep to the middle we can&rsquo;t be far
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pushed on a little.&nbsp; A hen grouse rose with a
frightening flutter from under his feet.&nbsp; She went whirring
away low over the heather with a harsh stuttering cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the cattypult, Morgan?&rsquo; Abner
cried.</p>
<p>And then they found water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come along, here&rsquo;s the pop-shop!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; The child ran forward and knelt above a tiny cup of
peat fringed with yellow stars of butterwort.&nbsp; He lapped up
the precious stuff eagerly like a dog, so greedily that he
choked, spluttered, and soused his white lace collar.&nbsp; Mary
wiped his face for him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go on!&rsquo; said Abner,
and she too stooped her aching back and drank.&nbsp; Abner drank
last, having laid Gladys down in the yielding heather and scooped
up water for her in his hands.</p>
<p>Now they were refreshed, almost joyful; but Mary could not
help looking anxiously at the hills in front of them, for every
moment it seemed to her that the heather grew blacker and the
distance fainter in the mist.</p>
<p>A crest that had once seemed unattainable fell behind
them.&nbsp; Reaching it they had expected to find themselves
looking down into the Wolfpits valley.&nbsp; Instead of this they
saw more broken walls and the outlines of two huge trees.&nbsp;
It puzzled them.&nbsp; It seemed that they had come to the edge
of a shallow basin scooped in the top of the hills.&nbsp; Perhaps
they might find a farm.&nbsp; The idea encouraged them.</p>
<p>They walked forward more quickly, for here the turf was smooth
and the heather no longer impeded them.&nbsp; The trees came up
out of the mist, not only two of them but a whole avenue of
beeches planted by the <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>hands of men, stretching away before
them in the line that they had followed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be a house,&rsquo; said Mary.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t plant trees like this for
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner nodded.&nbsp; In spite of his air of gaiety he had been
anxious and was now relieved.&nbsp; It was a noble avenue of more
than a hundred trees.&nbsp; They walked on midway between the two
lines of them, expecting at every moment to see the shadow of the
house.&nbsp; But the avenue ended suddenly as it had begun, and
instead of a house they saw nothing but two gateposts of stone,
ancient and weathered, surmounted by immense round balls.&nbsp;
The man who had built them two hundred years before had planned a
stately approach to his mansion.&nbsp; It was easy to imagine the
gates of wrought iron that would have swung there.&nbsp; But of
the house that he had dreamed there remained not as much as a
ghost.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be a house!&rsquo; Mary cried.</p>
<p>Abner shook his head.&nbsp; Nothing could now be seen but the
desolate line of the beech avenue stretching away behind
them.&nbsp; A light wind rose on their right, driving the mist in
front of it.&nbsp; They seemed to hear the endless volumes of it
hurrying by, but it was only the long sighing of a waste of
heather.&nbsp; This sound made Mary really aware of the
threatening silence that surrounded them.&nbsp; Even the presence
of Abner standing there as stolid and unmoved as ever could not
steady her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s an awful place.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like a
churchyard.&nbsp; Do let us go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She left the desolate gateposts with a shiver.&nbsp; She
hurried, taxing her strength to the last, to put them behind
her.&nbsp; The wind rose; the mist was whirled along the slopes
before them in torn fleeces.&nbsp; She crossed another ridge and
then sank down in the heather, ready to cry herself.&nbsp; The
buffetings of the wind were fit to break her heart.</p>
<p>Then a miracle happened.&nbsp; A gust of wind tore an opening
in the mist and the vision of a heaped mountainous landscape grew
before their eyes.&nbsp; Southward the indented bow of Radnor
Forest rose blue-black, the summit of Black Mixen hugely
threatening.&nbsp; Westward <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>in molten clouds the sun went down
over Wales and fifty miles of thin air and solid mountain were
mingled in a fiery haze.&nbsp; The sky was a furnace in which the
mountains melted away.&nbsp; But Abner and Mary had no desire to
see these splendours.&nbsp; Their eyes were fixed, peering into
the trough of the valley beneath them.&nbsp; They saw green
woods, blue in the evening light, the squares of barns, the rich
mosaic of fields, the gleam of a river.&nbsp; And their hearts
fell, for each was certain that the valley beneath them was not
that of the Folly Brook.&nbsp; It was far wilder and more
strange.&nbsp; They looked at each other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know where it is?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think, unless it&rsquo;s somewhere near
Clun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better get down while the light lasts.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s farms there,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; As he spoke the
sun dipped down.&nbsp; White clouds swept across their
window.&nbsp; Only the memory of what they had seen told them
that they were not utterly lost.</p>
<p>They descended the slope carefully, for the grass was slippery
and the only tracks were scattered with stones.&nbsp; Abner could
not help her; she knew that he was far too busy saving Gladys
from unnecessary jars.&nbsp; She fell, and Morgan cried out that
she had hurt his arm.&nbsp; She pulled her strength together and
tried to carry him.&nbsp; Somehow she must struggle on, for the
darkness was falling.&nbsp; Even with their sudden vision in her
mind she could not now feel certain that their direction was
right.&nbsp; For a time they followed a wheel-track skirting the
mountain, but it ended by turning upwards, and they knew that
this could not help them.&nbsp; Downward it was difficult to go,
for the fields were small and irregular, and the hedges often
impassable, yet downward, somehow, they must go.</p>
<p>They beat through a zone of these entanglements in wood and
stone.&nbsp; Night was falling fast.&nbsp; Since the revealing
moment of the last summit they had sunk so deep that they must
now surely be near the bottom of the valley, whatever valley it
might be.&nbsp; But when the barrier of irregular fields lay
behind them they found themselves on open, sloping ground
again.&nbsp; Abner stalked on ahead without pausing.&nbsp; She,
at the <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>end of her tether, called out after him to stop for a
moment, but he did not hear her.&nbsp; His shape went on into the
dusk, and she knew that if she did not follow she must be left
behind.</p>
<p>Suddenly the white air was full of the screaming of birds . .
. a shrill, high, sound that took her back into her
childhood.&nbsp; Once, with her father, she had been taken to
Swansea on a business trip and had heard gulls calling on the
Gower Cliffs.&nbsp; She felt that she must be dreaming.&nbsp;
Even on a night of storm no gulls could be blown so far inland as
this, and yet she was sure that her childish memory could not
have failed.&nbsp; The cries that she heard now were the cries of
gulls wheeling and screaming in the mist above her head.</p>
<p>Abner turned and called her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you ever hear
the like of it?&rsquo; he called.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never heard such
a chronic row!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re gulls,&rsquo; she shouted.&nbsp; Her
voice was thin in the mist.&nbsp; &lsquo;Seagulls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s where they must have come from.&nbsp; Off
of this water,&rsquo; he called.</p>
<p>And she saw, peering in front of her, a ghostly wood of pines
and before them a lake of dark water fringed with reeds.&nbsp;
The wind swept across it, bending the reeds, breaking the glassy
surface into ripples, and rolling milky mist before it.&nbsp; The
wind came in gusts, roaring through the trees with a noise that
was like that of the sea, and the gulls screamed above them,
unseen, as they might have screamed over storm-bound
cliffs.&nbsp; She stood with her knees trembling at Abner&rsquo;s
side, and Morgan clutched her hand.&nbsp; She herself felt like a
child, lonely, frightened.&nbsp; They stood so quietly together
that some of the birds swooped down on to the water as though
driven by the wind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re gulls,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Seagulls.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re more than fifty miles away
from the sea.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughed nervously.&nbsp; It came to her suddenly that she
could go no farther.&nbsp; Her legs could not make a single
step.&nbsp; The gulls came dropping down in twos and threes, and
settled on the lake.&nbsp; They were smaller than those that she
remembered, she thought.&nbsp; They <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>dropped down just like pigeons when
you scatter grain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
near dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she could not move.&nbsp; The child tugged at her
skirt.&nbsp; She felt the tugging in a dream.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t stand staring here all night,&rsquo;
Abner was saying.&nbsp; She was aware of him standing beside her
in the dusk, holding Gladys to his breast.&nbsp; She saw the
child&rsquo;s white hands clasped about his neck, as quietly as
if she were asleep.&nbsp; She heard him, but could not
stir.&nbsp; Then Abner touched her upper arm, and the pressure of
his fingers went through her body like fire along a fuse
exploding some mine of passion that had lain hidden beneath her
long silence.&nbsp; It burned her like flame, burned her and rent
her. . . .&nbsp; She trembled and turned on him violently.&nbsp;
Words of abuse came tumbling out of her mouth.&nbsp; She did not
know or care what she was saying.&nbsp; She lashed him, wildly,
desperately.&nbsp; It was he who was to blame for all this
trouble, he who had persuaded her to take the children to Bron
and allowed her to be insulted in the inn at Redlake; he who had
entangled them in the crowd where Gladys&rsquo;s leg was broken;
and now he&rsquo;d lost them, and brought them to a place where
they might all die of cold with his damned foolishness.&nbsp;
Some devil inside her brain drove her on, delighting in the vile
things she said, raking up little grudges of the past and
throwing them in his face, revealing, against her will, such
petty miseries as her jealousy of Susie Hind.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s with her you ought to be,&rsquo; she cried,
&lsquo;instead of troubling us!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where you
ought to be!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better go on and leave us, Gladys
and Morgan and me.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know any more than I do
where we are, with the night coming on.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t go a
step farther, neither me nor Morgan, poor little thing!&nbsp; Oh,
go!&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; I wish to God I&rsquo;d never set eyes on
you!&rsquo; She threw herself down, exhausted, on the wet
grass.</p>
<p>He had stood up to it utterly bewildered.&nbsp; He
couldn&rsquo;t protest, for all her ravings were so childish, so
disconnected, so passionately illogical.&nbsp; He simply let her
go on until she had finished with him.&nbsp; Then <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>he
disengaged Gladys&rsquo;s arms from his neck and laid her down
gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re just about done in,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s natural.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again he placed his hand on Mary&rsquo;s arm, hoping to soothe
her and to persuade.&nbsp; She gave a strange shudder, as though
his fingers had been ice, and burst into tears, covering her face
with her hands.</p>
<p>He comforted her clumsily, talking to her as he would have
done to a child, until she no longer shrank from him, being too
weak to care.&nbsp; Then she took hold of his coat and clung to
him, still sobbing her heart away.&nbsp; She was broken . . .
quite broken.</p>
<p>The moment was terrible for Abner.&nbsp; He felt his heart
leap so wildly that he knew she must be conscious of its
thudding.&nbsp; The movement of her body, shaken with sobs,
against his own, filled him not with pity but with
exultation.&nbsp; There was no woman like her in the world.&nbsp;
He knew it.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t he known it long enough?&nbsp; If
he told himself the truth he must admit that for months he had
never wanted any other woman.&nbsp; The desires that had hungered
him the night before, walking beneath her window and in the
moonlit lane, returned to him in waves of greater force.&nbsp; He
laughed to think that, being so near to her, he should ever have
given a thought to Susie Hind.&nbsp; Now she was in his
arms.&nbsp; His hands caressed her beauty.&nbsp; How should he
touch her body without passion?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Surely she
could feel the blood beating in his fingers, even if she told
herself that he was only trying to comfort her.&nbsp; No one
could see them there . . . no one except the two children, crying
softly together because they heard their mother crying.&nbsp; Why
shouldn&rsquo;t he gather her in his arms, overwhelming her with
kisses?&nbsp; He could see nothing but her lips. . . .</p>
<p>But when he strained her to him she stopped sobbing and pushed
him away.&nbsp; It was now dark but for the light of the moon
hidden above the mist, and he could only see the paleness of her
face.&nbsp; Her ghost spoke to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my handkerchief,&rsquo; she said
simply.</p>
<p>He gave her his own, and she thanked him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve been saying,&rsquo;
she whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>think I must have been mad,
Abner.&nbsp; Please forget it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He would have helped her to her feet, but her muscles would
not respond to the brain&rsquo;s message.&nbsp; She gave a weak
laugh.&nbsp; Now she did not mind being weak.&nbsp; She looked at
him helplessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go another step,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Perhaps, if you
left us here, you might find if there&rsquo;s a house near.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll look after these poor lambs.&nbsp; We can keep warm
close together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No doubt she spoke wisely.&nbsp; He left them without a word,
though Gladys cried out with alarm to see him going.&nbsp; His
shoulders loomed up in the cloud, and as he skirted the lake the
gulls rose screaming from its surface to be lost in the sky.</p>
<p>Abner continued his course downhill.&nbsp; Relieved of the
weight of Gladys he now felt himself master of his limbs.&nbsp;
The hedges and the roughness of the road troubled him no longer,
and when he had been walking no more than ten minutes he saw in
the growing brilliance of the moonlight a gate that gave on to a
metalled road.&nbsp; He strained his ears to listen for any
sound, and heard, at length, the noise of a dog howling at the
hidden moon.&nbsp; That meant a farm, or at least a
shepherd&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; A walk of ten minutes in the
direction of the sound brought him within sight of a mass of
outbuildings that made a courtyard in front of a low-roofed
house.&nbsp; Two long windows on the right of a central doorway
were lighted.&nbsp; He saw the shadows of geraniums in pots
against the blinds.&nbsp; Another dog came at him out of the
darkness, snarling and sniffing him from a distance.&nbsp; He
knocked at the door and heard a chair pushed back over the stone
floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in . . . come in!&rsquo; some one cried.</p>
<p>The farm kitchen was bright, with a heavy brass lamp in the
centre of the table and a yellow shade that threw a mild radiance
over the many hams and sides of bacon that were slung from the
smoky ceiling.&nbsp; The table was laid for supper and a
shrewish-looking woman was eating bread and cheese.&nbsp; She
stared at Abner with a piece of cheese stuck on the end of her
knife, looking neither astonished nor frightened.</p>
<p><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>&lsquo;Who is it, please.&nbsp; And what do you want at
this time of night?&rsquo; she said, without moving.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to put you out, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Me and three others, a woman and two children,
lost our way coming over the hills from the fair.&nbsp; The
little girl&rsquo;s had an accident and we had to carry
her.&nbsp; Proper done in, they are, and I left them about a mile
away over there.&rsquo;&nbsp; He pointed in the direction of the
hills.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see how I can help you,&rsquo; said
the woman, who went on eating.&nbsp; &lsquo;The master never has
no dealings with gipsies.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more, he&rsquo;s
gone to the fair himself in the trap and ban&rsquo;t back
yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner explained to her that he was not a gipsy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t leave a woman an&rsquo; two kids out there
at night,&rsquo; he said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did you leave them?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Up by a pool.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a lot of birds on
it.&nbsp; Seagulls, she said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, ay, them&rsquo;s the sea-crows.&nbsp; They comes
here every year.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not ten minutes&rsquo;
walk from here, that isn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be a man about the place as can give me a
hand with them,&rsquo; said Abner, irritated by her
unconcern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All gone home an hour ago,&rsquo; she said, shaking her
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s only me and the master, and
he&rsquo;s not back yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment all the dogs began to bark together.&nbsp; She
got up and opened the door, and the lights of a gig turned the
corner and dashed into the yard.&nbsp; Another cob was tied to
the cart tail.&nbsp; The woman ran to meet the new-comer, and a
big man threw the reins over the horse&rsquo;s flanks and got out
of the trap.&nbsp; The dog yelped round him friendlily, and he
cursed it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get away!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d best take out,&rsquo; he said to the
woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m properly starved, I am.&nbsp; What
do you think of the new cob?&nbsp; Forty-eight pound!&nbsp; I
never knew such prices!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a chap here says he&rsquo;s a woman and
two children lost up by the sea-crows&rsquo; pool,&rsquo; she
said, disregarding his question.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better
go and have a word with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>&lsquo;Gipsies?&rsquo; he said angrily; but without
waiting for her reply he stalked stiffly into the room, slapping
his dank hands and blinking at the light.&nbsp; He stared at
Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;m George Malpas&rsquo;s lodger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner also recognised his host.&nbsp; It was Mr Williams of
Pentre Higgin, the farmer who had chosen himself foreman of the
jury at Bastard&rsquo;s inquest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what&rsquo;s all this I hear about a woman and
two kids?&rsquo; said the fanner threateningly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
that Malpas&rsquo;s wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner told him what had happened.&nbsp; What bewildered him
most was to realise that after all they had hit the upper part of
their own valley.&nbsp; The Pentre was indeed the farm on which
old Drew worked, and less than five miles from Wolfpits
itself.&nbsp; The farmer poured himself out a glass of cider and
stood smacking his lips while Abner told his story.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, this is a pretty turn-out!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I heard some talk of an accident to a little girl over
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went to the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hi!&rsquo; he shouted,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;d better put to again, missus!&nbsp; Shove the
new cob in the stall and give &rsquo;en some hay.&nbsp; Mind he
don&rsquo;t bite you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He chuckled to himself, being what people in those parts call
&lsquo;market-peart,&rsquo; then drank off another glass of
cider, and motioned to Abner to follow him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We&rsquo;d best find Badger to give us a hand,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>He tied the reins of the harnessed horse to a post in the
yard, and threw a blanket over its back.&nbsp; Abner followed him
silently out of the yard and up the road.&nbsp; They stopped in
front of a small cottage, and Williams knocked at the door.&nbsp;
After some delay Badger in his shirt-sleeves opened it, emitting
a queer odour of naphthaline and the dried skins of animals and
birds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put your coat on, Bill,&rsquo; said the farmer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Malpas&rsquo;s wife and kids is up by the sea-crows&rsquo;
pool.&nbsp; Got lost in the fog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments, as it seemed, they had found the
derelicts.&nbsp; By this time Mary protested, she was quite able
to walk.&nbsp; Abner again picked up Gladys, Williams carried
Morgan, and an easy path brought them down <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>to the farm
again.&nbsp; Badger walked beside Abner, but never spoke a
word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I reckon I&rsquo;ve got to drive you home,&rsquo;
said Williams sourly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better jump up
quick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lights of the house shone on Mary&rsquo;s pale face.&nbsp;
She did not look at Abner, but the woman of the farm, who
appeared to be Williams&rsquo;s wife, stared at her with hostile
eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-night, Bill!&rsquo; the farmer called, as
Badger slouched away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, Mr Badger!&rsquo; Abner added.&nbsp;
But Badger only mumbled something that he could not hear.</p>
<p>The sweating horse jogged easily down the lane to
Wolfpits.</p>
<h2><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>The
Nineteenth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> that night Abner heard Gladys
crying softly and Mary moving about in the room beneath
him.&nbsp; In the small hours she knocked at his door and begged
him to take Morgan into his bed.&nbsp; Gladys was so restless
that the child could not get to sleep.&nbsp; They spoke together
with the oak door between them, and a moment later, having
knocked again, she thrust a small, red-eyed figure into the
room.&nbsp; Abner picked him up and carried him into bed.&nbsp;
The child nestled close to him, like a small, warm-blooded
animal.&nbsp; Abner wrapped him up in his arms, protectively, as
though, by steadying his muscles, he could compel him to settle
down to sleep.&nbsp; Morgan&rsquo;s fingers lay gently on his
forearm, soft and listless.&nbsp; He was so quiet that Abner
thought he had fallen asleep already.&nbsp; In this he was
mistaken.&nbsp; The change of rooms and the adventure of finding
a new bedfellow had completely wakened him, and when he had lain
dead still for a little while, Morgan&rsquo;s fingers began to
stroke Abner&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; Then he fidgeted and spoke in a
reverent whisper:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, are you awake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, what is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why is your arm all hairy, Abner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&nbsp; Because I&rsquo;m grown up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mam&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Morgan, after a
thoughtful pause, and then: &lsquo;I like being here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t you go asking questions or I&rsquo;ll
put you out again,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>After this the child was quiet.&nbsp; He lay there burning in
Abner&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Falling asleep, his limbs relaxed, and
then, suddenly clutching at consciousness, twitched
violently.&nbsp; These movements were like those of a very young
animal, feeble and frightened, and Abner, feeling them, gathered
the child more closely in his arms, until he moved no longer save
with the gentle breathing of a sweet sleep.</p>
<p>Abner had never slept with a child before.&nbsp; It gave <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>him a
queer, almost physical sensation of comfort in addition to the
protective emotions which Morgan&rsquo;s helplessness
aroused.&nbsp; He had never thought seriously what it would be
like to have a child of his own, and even now he did not explain
his feelings in that way.&nbsp; He pictured himself, for a
moment, in the position of father to a child of Susie
Hind&rsquo;s, and the prospect did not move him.&nbsp; The only
way in which he could explain this curious enthralling tenderness
was by the fact that Morgan was really part of Mary, that the
child had come to him straight from the warmth of her arms,
carrying with him an impalpable essence of herself.&nbsp; He
wondered vaguely what he would have felt like if the child had
been not only Mary&rsquo;s but his as well, and in the midst of
these tender and dangerous reflections he fell asleep
himself.</p>
<p>Next morning, before returning to work, he left a message with
the doctor at Lesswardine, asking him to call at Wolfpits.&nbsp;
All through the day he was restless and unhappy, feeling that his
proper place was at Wolfpits lending Mary a hand, supporting her
anxieties.&nbsp; He consoled himself with the knowledge that Mrs
Mamble was used to domestic troubles and would probably be of
more use to Mary than himself, even apart from the fact that
their finances would not easily stand the strain of the lost
time.&nbsp; He only wondered, all the time, what the
doctor&rsquo;s report would be, and whether their wild
night-journey might have added to the child&rsquo;s injury.&nbsp;
He did not mention anything of what had happened to his mates,
and the day was therefore long and anxious.</p>
<p>It was after dinner-time when the doctor reached
Wolfpits.&nbsp; Escorted by Mrs Mamble, he soon got to business
and took down the injured limb, complimenting the Brampton Bryan
surgeon on the way in which he had done his job.&nbsp; The
dislocated fragments, he said, had been skilfully opposed, and
the leg now lay in a good position.&nbsp; Gladys was young, a
child&rsquo;s tissues were full of vitality, and the splint,
which he put on again, need not be worn for more than three
weeks.</p>
<p>He stayed a little longer than he need have done, for <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>he had
finished his round and Mary Malpas was an attractive woman.&nbsp;
He was a middle-aged man and not above taking a kind of guarded
pleasure in the intimacy with such charming creatures that his
profession gave him.&nbsp; He asked her how it had all happened,
and Mary told him, without hesitation, of their train journey two
nights before, of their difficulty of finding rooms at Redlake,
and of all that had led up to the accident.&nbsp; He listened
gravely, giving no sign of unusual interest when Abner&rsquo;s
name was mentioned, but when he drove away again he chuckled to
himself, being intrigued by this new little sidelight on the
frailty of human nature, and taking an interest that was not
wholly professional in the idea of this extraordinarily desirable
woman finding consolation in the arms of her lodger.&nbsp; For
that was how he interpreted the case.</p>
<p>When he got home that evening he told the story to his
wife.&nbsp; Little incidents of this kind, which came so often
into his professional experience, supplied him with a vicarious
sexual stimulus which his marital relations had lacked for some
years.&nbsp; Mrs Hendrie, listening, pursed her lips, and
smiled.&nbsp; The story was not one for general publication, but
she knew that it would be acceptable to the vicar&rsquo;s wife,
who had already taken such a kindly, if profitless, interest in
this unfortunate young woman.</p>
<p>In this way the scandal of the Redlake adventure began to be
whispered in that most exclusive circle of which the sewing-party
at the vicarage was the centre.&nbsp; In this quarter, indeed,
Mary had been already judged and damned as a woman who preferred
a life of open sin to the privilege of attending to the
blameless, physical needs of the Rev. Cyril Malpas.&nbsp; The new
intelligence did no more than supply a sorrowful confirmation of
what was already suspected.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s those two
sweet children I&rsquo;m thinking of,&rsquo; said the
vicar&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;Imagine the awful effects of
surroundings of that kind in later life!&rsquo;&nbsp; The vicar
only shook his head.&nbsp; After all, Wolfpits was so very nearly
in his neighbour&rsquo;s parish as to make him scarcely
responsible.</p>
<p>It came as a great relief to Abner to find that Gladys was
none the worse for her journey in his arms.&nbsp; In <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>the morning
they pulled round the long kitchen settle into the sun, and in
the evening he carried this out of doors so that the child might
enjoy the mellow light with the others.&nbsp; She took a few days
to get over the original shock of the accident, but after that
she settled down into a placid convalescence, fully aware of her
importance and treating, not only Mary and Mrs Mamble, but Abner
and Mick Connor, as her slaves.&nbsp; Morgan was vaguely jealous
of the attention that they paid her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But <i>I</i> slep&rsquo; with Abner,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;and Gladys an&rsquo;t, has her, mam?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary smiled at him.&nbsp; Now that she knew that
Gladys&rsquo;s injury was not so severe as they had imagined she
could afford to smile, sitting there in the summer evening with
her friends about her.&nbsp; It was so quiet at Wolfpits.&nbsp;
Not even the birds were singing.&nbsp; She sat there and heard
the trout rising and plopping in the pool beneath the bridge, a
hundred yards away, and then the murmurous wings of a
humming-bird-hawk moth, hovering in a nebula of bronze, swooping
to plunge its curled trumpet into the cups of flowers.&nbsp; Then
beetles droned above them and bats zig-zagged with rapid
wings.&nbsp; She told Abner that it was time for him to take the
settle into the house.&nbsp; While he did so she held Gladys in
her lap and watched the man&rsquo;s big shoulders as he moved
almost without effort under the weight of the settle.&nbsp; It
reminded her of another memory of him that she knew she would
never forget: a picture of trailing mists and loneliness, and a
man walking before her with a child in his arms.</p>
<p>In this state of happiness and innocence neither of them
suspected any mischief of tongues.&nbsp; It is true that Abner
had found the presence of Badger at the Pentre on the night of
the fair a little sinister at first, but the fact that they had
chosen to descend into the Wolfpits valley at the level of the
sea-crows&rsquo; pool and Williams&rsquo;s farm was the purest
accident, and Mary, who only knew the keeper by name, and had
never seen him outside a court of law, thought nothing of it,
while Mr Williams of the Pentre never entered into their
calculations as a source of evil.</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>But
Williams, in spite of his ready kindness in driving them back to
Wolfpits with his tired horse, had chuckled to find in this
incident a chance of annoying his old enemy, Mrs Malpas of the
Buffalo.&nbsp; In all things he was a gross and childish man,
whose plan of life embraced only two classes of acquaintance,
enemies and friends, and he spent the greater part of his time in
scheming to annoy the former and overwhelm the latter with the
most na&iuml;ve of kindnesses.&nbsp; As for Mrs Malpas, not even
pity for her in the affair of George could induce him to forget
his quarrel over the hogshead of cider.&nbsp; He knew very well
that her weak spot was her own claim to an unassailable chapel
morality, and having already enjoyed the pleasure of scoring her
off by sending her only son on his first stage to Shrewsbury as a
felon, he could not now resist the satisfaction of telling her
that her daughter-in-law had been away with the lodger while
George was in Salop jail.</p>
<p>Next week, at Ludlow market, he entertained the farmers&rsquo;
ordinary with the story, and in the evening, having done a good
day&rsquo;s business and drunk enough to make him fear no man, he
drove home, chuckling to himself, by way of Chapel Green, pulling
up at the Buffalo for a final drink.&nbsp; It was the first time
that he had visited the inn since that unfortunate quarrel.&nbsp;
The cloggers who had gone away in the previous winter had found
lodgings in a village farther westward on their return in the
spring, and the Buffalo had never emerged from the silence in
which they had left it.&nbsp; Mrs Malpas seemed surprised that
any one should call so late at night.&nbsp; The bar was empty,
and she had to light the swinging oil lamp for him, standing on a
chair.&nbsp; Williams himself found a match and lit it for her
out of sheer fuddled kindness.&nbsp; It struck her that he was
too kind by half.&nbsp; He drank his whisky standing in the
middle of the taproom, smacking it on his tongue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t go to Bron Fair, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; Mrs Malpas replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nor have I
these many years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s pretty things to be seen there,&rsquo;
said Williams, with a grin.&nbsp; She made no reply, and he
advanced obliquely from another angle.</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>&lsquo;How&rsquo;s your son getting on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But for the shame that we all bear, Mr Williams,
he&rsquo;s out of harm&rsquo;s way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a good Christian prison, I&rsquo;m
told,&rsquo; said he, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Chaplains and
all!&nbsp; How&rsquo;s his wife, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Mrs Malpas
shortly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t want to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Smart looking young woman!&rsquo; Williams leered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know nothing about her, Mr Williams.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you something, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s been off on the spree, childer an&rsquo; all, to Bron
Fair.&nbsp; Slept the night at the Harley Arms, Redlake, with
that lodger chap.&nbsp; What do you think of that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Malpas blenched.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s your story, Mr
Williams, but there&rsquo;s no need to believe you, thanks
be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But seeing&rsquo;s believing, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said
Williams heavily.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I seen.&nbsp; What is it I owe
you now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gasped: &lsquo;Sixpence,&rsquo; and took the money.&nbsp;
Williams gave her a cheery good-night.&nbsp; He wondered at the
way in which she had taken his scandal.&nbsp; &lsquo;A proper
hard old case, an&rsquo; no mistake!&rsquo; he thought.&nbsp; Mrs
Malpas, forgetful of economy, left the light burning and went
straight in to her husband.&nbsp; In moments of stress, even
though she despised him and knew that he hardly understood her,
she would use him as a dummy on which to vent her feelings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dad, dad!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;That was Mr
Williams of the Pentre.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, mother . . . good land, good land!&nbsp; Williams.
. . .&nbsp; Ay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has a tale of our George&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s going on with that Fellows as lodges with them, the
one that brought trouble on George.&nbsp; They was caught the two
on them, at the Harley Arms, Redlake.&nbsp; You know . .
.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man, who was now awake, mumbled something about that
being in the nature of things when a young woman was left too
long to herself.&nbsp; She picked up the word furiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nature!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the
nature of a brute beast, not the nature of a Christian
woman!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the bad blood in her!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>He
let her rave on in the dark.&nbsp; It was late, and now unlikely
that any one else would call in at the bar.&nbsp; His head
nodded, while she went on fuming, half to him and half to
herself.&nbsp; She persuaded herself that her morality had been
offended, though it was really the spiteful satisfaction of
Williams rather than his news that had wounded her, for she could
not think any worse of Abner and Mary than she did already.&nbsp;
When the heat of her irritation against the farmer subsided, its
place was taken by another and more subtle flame.&nbsp; She
realised that she had found something to explain her former
unreasonable hatred.&nbsp; Williams, in trying to shame her, had
put a new weapon into her hands, one with which she might
positively injure Abner and Mary together in George&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; It had been the hardest part of her dealings with him
at the time of the trial to see the way in which his loyalty to
Mary, however little that might mean, returned.&nbsp; Now that
her chance had come, George couldn&rsquo;t keep up this
sentimental pretence of a belief in Mary&rsquo;s goodness any
longer.&nbsp; Williams had justified her at last.</p>
<p>She helped the old man up to bed, blew out his candle, and
left him in the dark.&nbsp; Then she went downstairs, carried the
lamp from the bar into the parlour, took out a sheet of lined
paper, and a penholder carved out of olive wood from the garden
of Gethsemane, and&mdash;began a letter to George.&nbsp; She
wrote without haste, in the firm pointed characters that she had
learnt as a young girl, carefully, methodically, with a perfect
and cold precision.&nbsp; From first to last not the least quaver
of indecision stayed her pen; but when she held the paper to the
light to read what she had written, her hands trembled and the
words ran like fire across her brain.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Your loving mother</i>,<br />

<p>She sighed, sealed the envelope, and addressed it
to:&mdash;</p>

<p>Then she folded her spectacles, blew out the light, and went
upstairs in the dark to the room where her husband was already
snoring.&nbsp; She crept into bed beside him and soon fell asleep
in the blessed consciousness of innocence.</p>
<p>Williams, blabbing to old Mrs Malpas in the childish hope of
irritating her, was not the only person who found an interest in
spreading the story.&nbsp; Badger, pulled into the mist out of
the stink of his preservatives and walking sullenly up the slope
toward the sea-crows&rsquo; pool, had slowly realised that here
was an opportunity of discrediting Abner in the eyes of Susie
Hind once and for all.&nbsp; Although the lovers&rsquo; meetings
had of late been fewer and secret, while Susie, reminded from
time to time of the keeper&rsquo;s jealousy, had been clever
enough <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>to laugh him off and to make him feel ridiculous,
Badger had not forgotten his suspicions.&nbsp; It was true that
he never now saw Abner at the Pound House, and never heard his
name mentioned outside the tirades of Mr Hind, who was still
anxious for his licence, but the rearing of his young pheasants
was now keeping Badger busy, and since he had no time to waste in
watching, he could never be quite sure that Abner was not
profiting by his forced neglect.&nbsp; Sometimes he would
threaten Susie as he had done before, pretending that he knew
more than he did; but experience had taught her how to deal with
this crude creature; she treated his violence as though it amused
her, and he always ended by accepting what she said with certain
dark reservations that only troubled him beneath the threshold of
consciousness, and set him strangely wondering at night.</p>
<p>In the middle of one of these doubting moods Williams had come
knocking at his door with Abner beside him, asking for his help
in the search for Mary, and next day he and his neighbour had
talked together, Williams delighted as a child in his discovery
of such frailty in old Mrs Malpas&rsquo;s daughter-in-law.&nbsp;
Badger cared nothing one way or the other for Mary&rsquo;s
chastity, he had no particular grudge against Mrs Malpas or her
son, but he quickly saw that in Williams&rsquo;s discovery he had
hit on a rare touchstone for Susie&rsquo;s feelings toward
Abner.&nbsp; He saw that he must make use of it before the tale
became common talk, so he cornered Susie at the first opportunity
that he found, and told her, as bluntly as was his custom, what
had happened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s brazen-faced enough, that chap
Fellows,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;seeing that he told Mr Williams
right out that he and George Malpas&rsquo;s wife had slept at the
Harley Arms, over Redlake way.&nbsp; Took the two children with
&rsquo;em and all!&nbsp; That was the rum part of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>While he spoke he watched Susie with his small keen eyes,
sharpened by the habit of observing wild game, waiting for her
face to betray to him exactly what she felt toward Abner.&nbsp;
But it was not for nothing that Susie had learnt the art of being
all things to all men.&nbsp; Badger&rsquo;s eyes were a little
too eager, and she was quick to see it.</p>
<p><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>&lsquo;Why do you want to tell me this, Mr
Badger?&rsquo; she said slowly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s an old friend of yours.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t put me off as easy as that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you might have saved yourself the trouble,&rsquo;
she said, turning her back on him.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you&rsquo;ve
any other dirty stories to tell, I&rsquo;ll be obliged if
you&rsquo;ll keep them to yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He flushed darkly, so that she felt she was overdoing
it.&nbsp; She came back to him and stood talking of other things,
her hand on the table within an inch of his own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t take any offence,&rsquo; she
said softly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only I don&rsquo;t like to hear my name
coupled with a chap of that kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Badger swallowed his liquor with satisfaction.&nbsp; It seemed
to him that he had artfully secured his point.&nbsp; He looked
Susie up and down, appraising her, lazily satisfied.&nbsp; She
had gained a new value in his eyes.&nbsp; He held her in talk,
and she loitered by his table, standing on one leg.&nbsp; In
taking away his glass she even touched his hand.&nbsp; They were
alone in the bar.&nbsp; He caught her and kissed her.&nbsp;
Protesting, as a matter of form, she smiled.&nbsp; In her heart
she hated him like poison.&nbsp; Her mind was aflame with vague
jealousies, for any fool could see that Abner was worth two of
this man.</p>
<p>That night she heard the gang from the pipe-track discussing
the accident at Bron, winking at each other over the way in which
the story had come out.&nbsp; They laughed without
condemning.&nbsp; To them it seemed no more than a good
joke.&nbsp; When her father&rsquo;s back was turned the Gunner
began to pull her leg about it; but she laughed back at him,
giving him coarseness for coarseness, and went on wiping her
glasses, humming to herself the refrain of a pantomime
tune.&nbsp; She heard herself singing.&nbsp; Her voice sounded
toneless and unreal.&nbsp; When she went to bed she could not
sleep for fretting.&nbsp; Abner had not been near her for more
than a week, and she did not dare to take the risk of sending him
a message at his work.&nbsp; She knew that she wanted him.&nbsp;
She was not going to lose him without a fight.</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>Next
afternoon she was free, and knowing that Abner would be safely at
work, she dressed herself elaborately in her best clothes and a
pair of new shoes and set off boldly for Wolfpits.&nbsp; Her
hands trembled and her frock was drenched with perspiration as
she dressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you off to, got up like that?&rsquo; her
father called after her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I dress as I like, dad?&rsquo; she said,
with a toss of her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s tempest about.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get
soaked to the skin!&rsquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>She felt as if she were soaked to the skin already.&nbsp; The
long spell of rainless weather had reached its climax, and the
delaine frock that she had chosen had been cut for elegance
rather than for comfort.&nbsp; The sun went in, leaving a white
and heavy sky.&nbsp; The leaves of elm and chestnut drooped in
the heat as with the weight of their own dust.&nbsp; Her new
shoes were too small for her, and by the time that she had toiled
up to the bridge over the Folly, she wished that she had not
come.&nbsp; A yaffle mocked her from the edge of the wood.&nbsp;
Swallows were hawking low down over the dust of the road.&nbsp;
An awful, oppressive silence weighed on the land.&nbsp; She
hesitated, then turned painfully up the Wolfpits avenue, but when
she had almost decided to turn back, the thunder broke above her
and big drops spattered the dust.&nbsp; The thought of the new
tulle in her hat made her run for shelter.&nbsp; The trees of the
avenue gave a long sigh and the rain swished down in
torrents.&nbsp; Round the corner she saw Mrs Mamble running
about, like a woman possessed, after the washing that she had
spread on the bushes to dry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Slip into the porch, miss,&rsquo; she cried, catching
sight of Susie, &lsquo;or you&rsquo;ll be drownded.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then she called to Mary, who was ironing in the kitchen:
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a young lady got caught in the storm, Mrs
Malpas!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please come inside and wait till it&rsquo;s
over,&rsquo; Mary cried, glancing through the window.</p>
<p>Susie entered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take a seat,&rsquo; Mary said, and
went on with her ironing.&nbsp; One side of her face was flushed
with the heat of the iron that she had tested by holding it to
her cheek.&nbsp; It made her look as if she were angry <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>or
embarrassed.&nbsp; The kitchen was full of the sweet, scorched
smell of linen.&nbsp; Susie, sitting nervously on the edge of the
seat to which she had been shown, felt that the falseness of her
position must be made clear.&nbsp; She was out to fight, and not
without courage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name is Hind . . . Susan Hind,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;From the Pound House, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary stopped ironing and looked at her.&nbsp; She began to
wish that she had not turned herself out so elegantly.&nbsp; She
felt that she must look like a street-woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes . . . I thought I knew you,&rsquo; Mary said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came over to speak to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Susie
hesitated: &lsquo;About Mr Fellows . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a tale going round . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; She
faltered.&nbsp; She wished that she were not sitting on the edge
of the chair, that Mary were not taller than herself.&nbsp; There
was something unfair and consciously superior in the
woman&rsquo;s plain white apron.&nbsp; More than this, she had
the subtle, inexplicable advantage of being a married woman with
children . . . even if her husband had deserted her.&nbsp; Mary
put down her iron on its stand and looked her full in the
eyes.&nbsp; Now her cheeks were equally flushed.&nbsp; Susie
wished that she would speak, even if she were only to repeat her
provocative &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;&nbsp; She took fright suddenly,
stood up, and plunged.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
know it&rsquo;s not fair!&nbsp; You, a married woman, that have
had your life and a couple of children!&nbsp; But as soon as your
husband&rsquo;s well out of sight you must go running after
another man.&nbsp; Take his money&mdash;that&rsquo;s one
thing!&nbsp; But take him&mdash;that&rsquo;s another!&nbsp; I
suppose you&rsquo;re the kind that can&rsquo;t make yourself
happy unless you&rsquo;re making some man soft on you . . . so
they can hang round you and you play the lady on them!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you imagine I don&rsquo;t know the dog&rsquo;s life
you give George!&nbsp; And now you&rsquo;ve got hold of your
lodger&mdash;lodger, I says!&mdash;and turned him crazy.&nbsp;
Call yourself a lady!&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t every one know what
your father was?&nbsp; We all know about that.&nbsp; George
himself told me.&nbsp; And I can tell you what you are,
straight.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re nothing better <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>than a
whore on the streets if the truth was known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary trembled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shout so!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t shout so!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what you mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What I mean?&rsquo; cried Susie hysterically.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What I mean?&nbsp; Why, going about the country in strange
places and laying about with single men.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
I mean.&nbsp; Call yourself a married woman . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re wrong . . . you&rsquo;re quite
wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I wrong then?&nbsp; I know whose word I&rsquo;d
sooner take: Mr Williams&rsquo;s and Mr Badger&rsquo;s or
yourn!&nbsp; I know that was the first time it came out, but that
makes no difference to what every one in the district has known
for a fact these months.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you one
thing&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you forget it!&mdash;you&rsquo;re not
going to take Abner off me.&nbsp; Not if I kill him first.&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;m not talking wild, understand.&nbsp; I mean
it.&nbsp; If I have to shame you to your face I&rsquo;m not going
to let him go.&nbsp; Shame . . .&rsquo; she laughed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a fine word to use for the likes of
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave a gasp for breath, then, with a flash of hopeless
hatred, as though she were searching the room for something that
her violence might appropriately destroy, she went out blindly
into the rain.</p>
<p>Mary stood rigidly at her ironing-table.&nbsp; A flash of
lightning ripped the sky in front of her window, nearly blinding
her, and her lips uttered a cry.&nbsp; Mrs Mamble ran in with her
skirt thrown over her head, for she was frightened of
thunder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My!&rsquo; she cried from under the skirt.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My, what a downpour!&rsquo;&nbsp; She looked out
timidly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I never!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mary, with a helpless laugh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone?&nbsp; Why, the girl must be mad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again Mary laughed at the wide astonishment in Mrs
Mamble&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Another flash followed and the old
woman wrapped up her head again, waiting for the thunder.&nbsp;
It came with a crash, right overhead, and the house shook.&nbsp;
Mary suddenly remembered the children, who were playing in the
parlour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do go and see to them, Mrs Mamble,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>She
herself could not move.&nbsp; She went on folding her
linen.&nbsp; It seemed as if she must find some mechanical task
for her hands to do.&nbsp; In a moment Mrs Mamble returned to say
that the children were not in the least frightened.&nbsp; She
kept dodging in and out of the house all afternoon for fear of
the storm returning and catching her unawares, telling of the
damage that the rain might have done to the hay lying out in the
meadows or to the standing corn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there&rsquo;s no denying that it&rsquo;s
wanted,&rsquo; she said inconsequently.</p>
<p>By the time that Abner left work that evening the storm had
rolled away, rumbling over the treetops of Bringewood
Chase.&nbsp; All day he had worked under the heavy sky, breathing
an air that was dead and choked with dust.&nbsp; Now the vault
was clear and brilliant as that of an evening in spring.&nbsp;
The smell of dust rose from the road, blackbirds were singing,
and from the pale, steaming hayfields waves of sweetness drifted
across his path.&nbsp; His steps were light and his heart
happy.</p>
<p>Mary received him as usual and gave him his tea.&nbsp; He
laughed with her over the violence of the storm and asked her
gaily if the doctor had been to take the splint off
Gladys&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must put by a shillin&rsquo; or two for that,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; For the moment he was so full of his own content
that he had scarcely noticed her preoccupation; but when he
mentioned money she made a quick, instinctive movement, as though
she wanted to speak and to refuse it.&nbsp; Little by little he
began to realise that she was trying to avoid him and sometimes
leaving his questions unanswered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up with you, missus?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing at
all that I know of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But her denial did not convince him.&nbsp; All the evening he
tried to guess what could have upset her, but she evaded him,
pretending that she was her normal self.&nbsp; He knew
better.&nbsp; Even when she spoke to the children or to Mrs
Mamble, who came in to talk about the havoc of the storm and to
give them the news that a sheep had been struck by lightning on
Williams&rsquo;s farm, Mary was listless and dull.</p>
<p><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>Abner
used her gently.&nbsp; He knew that women must have their moods,
and that a man needed to be patient with them if he would be
happy; but day after day now passed without any change in her
attitude.&nbsp; Since the discovery of his own passion that he
had made by the sea-crows&rsquo; pool, it had been hard enough as
it was for him to live with her on ordinary terms; but now, even
though he humoured her, she was distant with him.</p>
<p>He tried to make her explain herself.&nbsp; She only shook her
head.&nbsp; It seemed, indeed, as if a single day had thrown them
back into all the awkwardness of his early life at Wolfpits, and
that she had suddenly taken it into her head to upset the
convention under which they had agreed to live.&nbsp; Most of
all, she avoided him whenever he spoke of money, and when he
brought her his wages at the end of the week she left them lying
on the table as though touching them would have burned her
fingers.&nbsp; If he had not loved the woman, and her children
too, he would have broken away in accordance with his
nature.&nbsp; As it was, he hung on, sore and bewildered,
wondering what new coldness she could inflict upon him.</p>
<p>Another shock awaited her.&nbsp; One day, when Abner was away
at work, the postman bicycled up to Wolfpits and handed her a
letter.&nbsp; This was so rare an event at Wolfpits that the man
waited, as country postmen, who also act as interpreters, often
do, to hear its contents.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see by the postmark it&rsquo;s come from
Shrewsbury,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, so I see,&rsquo; she replied, thrusting it into
the pocket of her apron.</p>
<p>She had already recognised George&rsquo;s freehand
writing.&nbsp; He went away, but she kept the letter in her
pocket unopened.&nbsp; She dared not open it; and when at last
she did so, the words sent a chill over all her body.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap"><i>My dear
Wife</i></span>,&rsquo;&mdash;<i>she read,
shivering</i>&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Although I may be doing time
I&rsquo;m not yet dead that I know of</i>.&nbsp; <i>They say that
love is blind</i>, <i>but don&rsquo;t you go imagining that other
people haven&rsquo;t got eyes</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>Your loving
husband</i>,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap"><i>George</i></span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>She
was seized with a pain that had scarcely abated when Abner came
home at night.&nbsp; She could not bring herself to speak to
him.&nbsp; She desired, passionately, to show him the letter, but
shame would not let her do so.&nbsp; He, in his turn, was sick of
the wretchedness of their present relation, and when the children
had been put to bed, he told her so in words that he had chosen
for their roughness.&nbsp; She stared at him from the other side
of the supper table with grief and resentment in her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it&rsquo;s as bad as that, what makes you stay
here?&rsquo; she said slowly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like that!&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know
as well as I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took fright at this, for she wasn&rsquo;t sure of his
meaning, though she knew in her heart what she wanted him to
mean.&nbsp; She was afraid that he would guess at her unspoken
admission.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t keep you here,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>He got up and walked the room.&nbsp; A hay-moth hurled itself
against the shade of the lamp with a sharp ringing sound and fell
crippled on the tablecloth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s hurt,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Kill
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner crushed the insect with his thumb and threw it in the
fireplace.&nbsp; The coppery bloom came off on his fingers.&nbsp;
For a moment she was hypnotised watching him.&nbsp; Then she
recovered her senses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t keep you.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no need for
you to stay in every night,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. There bain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m damned if there
be!&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>He picked up his cap and walked out of the room.&nbsp; She
nearly ran after him to thrust George&rsquo;s letter into his
hand.&nbsp; But she was too late.&nbsp; &lsquo;So much the
better,&rsquo; she thought.&nbsp; She felt that she had been
saved from some calamity.</p>
<p>He set off, walking furiously through the mellow evening,
trying to cool his blood with violent exertion as instinctively
as an animal eats grass.&nbsp; By nightfall he had reached the
remote valley, nine miles away in folds of the Forest of Clun,
whither his friends the cloggers had returned in the
spring.&nbsp; He found their <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>canvas pitched in a coomb under high
sheepwalks, and Wigan Joe made him as welcome as ever.&nbsp; They
sat out in the soft, moonless night, talking and drinking
beer.&nbsp; It was like old times for Abner to hear Joe reeling
off stories one after another in his flat Lancashire
dialect.&nbsp; He lolled there listening till the company grew
drowsy.&nbsp; There was no question of his returning to Wolfpits
that night, for the sky drooped like a pall of velvet on the
earth and he could never have found his way.&nbsp; He turned in
with the others on a pile of dried bracken, waking at dawn to set
off again toward Chapel Green.</p>
<p>For a few hours he had shed his restlessness, but when he
reached Wolfpits in the evening the sense of restraint descended
on him again.&nbsp; He felt that Mary was watching him, wondering
where he had been.&nbsp; Her eyes were tragic, and, as he
thought, reproachful.</p>
<p>This only irritated him.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t be bothered
with her moods.&nbsp; When, speaking to Mrs Mamble, he happened
to mention that he had walked over in the evening to the
sloggers&rsquo; workings, she looked at him with such a searching
suspicion that he could not contain himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up with you?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m codding you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked away without answering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no need to believe me if you don&rsquo;t
want to,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>And what the hell did it matter to her where he went or what
he did?&nbsp; If he were to leave her to herself for a bit
perhaps she&rsquo;d begin to realise that he was useful, and that
it wouldn&rsquo;t pay her to treat him like dirt.&nbsp; It was
time she had a lesson!</p>
<p>He spent the next evening with Mick Connor in a pub at
Lesswardine, mixing his drinks, standing treat recklessly.&nbsp;
He had to borrow six shillings from Mick to pay his score.&nbsp;
It pleased him to think how Mary would stare at his money next
Saturday when she found it six bob short . . . she, who was too
proud to pick it up when he gave it her!</p>
<p>At the yellow turnpike house outside Lesswardine their paths
diverged; and this was unfortunate, for it was easier to walk arm
in arm.&nbsp; Mick left him; but as <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>soon as he found himself alone the
vision of Mary returned to him: Mary, as he had seen her and
desired her, sitting pale on the border of the pool a fortnight
ago.&nbsp; In his perverse and drunken mind he hated her.&nbsp;
It seemed to him that she had been making a fool of him,
alternately alluring and rejecting.</p>
<p>He walked along, sweating violently, in the direction of
Mainstone, wishing to God he&rsquo;d never known the damned
woman.&nbsp; Women . . . and yet a lusty man of his age
couldn&rsquo;t live without women!&nbsp; It was against nature to
live without women, and a man was a fool if he did so.&nbsp; He
went hot and cold, thrilled with voluptuous sensations.&nbsp; He
laughed at himself, and staggered up to a gate at the side of the
road to light his pipe.&nbsp; He broke three matches and then
discovered that they were damp and would not strike.&nbsp; He
remembered indefinitely that Mick had upset a pint of beer into
his pocket.&nbsp; He cursed the matches and Mick together.</p>
<p>A light breeze moved above him, and as in the distance he
heard a sound like that of a gentle shower falling on leaves in
June: a sound that meant something to his memory.&nbsp; He became
suddenly aware that he was standing at that moment on the
outskirts of Mainstone village, immediately beneath a big poplar
tree.&nbsp; A dozen times he had stood there in the shadow
waiting for the light to go out in the windows of the Pound
House, for the steps of Bastard to pass him, for the moment when
he might safely steal across to Susie&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>His pulse quickened.&nbsp; Some hidden instinct must have made
him stop there.&nbsp; No light could be seen, but there, in the
darkness, was a woman whom he could have for the asking.&nbsp; He
pulled himself together, and a moment later was standing by the
outhouse door.&nbsp; He threw a clod at her window-pane.&nbsp;
She had better not try putting him off to-night!&nbsp; If he had
to climb in at her window she must come to him.&nbsp; He fretted
with impatience.</p>
<p>But he had not long to wait.&nbsp; In a few minutes she had
opened the back door.&nbsp; He heard the door scrape, but it was
so dark that he could not see her.&nbsp; He put <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>out his
hands, groping in the darkness, and found her, warm and
breathing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you were never coming again,&rsquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>He took her in his arms and clothed her in kisses.&nbsp; She
clung to him, breathing softly, while his kisses enveloped
her.&nbsp; His misery left him, vanished miraculously in the
darkness.&nbsp; In the black confusion of his thoughts it seemed
to him as if he were kissing Mary Malpas.</p>
<h2><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>The
Twentieth Chapter</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">strange</span> fate awaited this renewal
of passion.&nbsp; Over the border in Wales, where many dark and
violent things are born, a sultry flame had been kindled about
this time in the heart of a Wesleyan local preacher named Evan
Hughes.&nbsp; He was a Montgomery peasant, a carpenter by trade,
on whom, brooding over the historical sanctity of his calling, an
inspiration had fallen.&nbsp; He preached in the chapel Bethesda,
in the hamlet Llandewi Waterdine.&nbsp; He spoke in the dialect
of his fellow-workmen; his words were ludicrous and pathetic; but
the fire that scorched his heart was in them, so that men and
women rode over the mountains on their ponies to hear him and
many professed themselves converted.&nbsp; Why, or to what they
were converted it would be hard to say, unless it were that the
isolation of their lives laid them open to long broodings on sin
and on salvation, and that knowing, as all men know, that they
were sinful, they could not be happy in solitude till they were
saved.</p>
<p>The unconverted said maliciously that Evan Hughes had been
shocked into sanctity by proceedings of affiliation and a
maintenance order.&nbsp; However this may have been, his
preaching was on chastity of the body, and more particularly of
the bodies of women, a doctrine that was acceptable, for the most
obvious reasons, to married men with wives younger than
themselves, and on sentimental grounds to young unmarried
girls.&nbsp; The flame spread quickly through these green shoots,
and the dry, withered twigs went up with a crackle.&nbsp; Women
of sixty years and older stood up on the chapel floor and prayed
God to grant them continence.&nbsp; Evan Hughes, with a singular
lack of humour, hailed them as souls plucked from hell and
greeted them as sisters. Thus, having cleansed the Kerry Hills
and the borders of Clun, he set his eyes, like any spiritual
freebooter, on the English border, cursing the fatness and
laxness of the Teme valley so violently and with such free <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>quotations
from the prophet Jeremiah, that the local circuit invited him to
conduct a revival from their pulpits.</p>
<p>First he came to Chapel Green, and naturally enough converted
old Mrs Malpas, who was always on the side of the angels.&nbsp;
She sat under him with tears streaming from her eyes for the sins
of her friends, and afterward had the honour of putting him up at
the Buffalo in spite of his prejudices against the licensed
trade.&nbsp; On this, the first Sunday of the revival, the Chapel
Green Methodists achieved the authentic shiver, and the vicar of
Mainstone, who had heard all about it, made a reconnaissance of
his parish, shaking his head and warning his people against the
influence of unhealthy fanatics.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a crime,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;putting such
ideas into young people&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want
that sort of thing in the country.&nbsp; Mainstone is a clean
parish.&nbsp; Apart from that unfortunate young Mrs Malpas at
Wolfpits there is scarcely an . . . unsavoury household in
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this official discouragement, Evan Hughes
increased.&nbsp; The revival, unlike those epidemics of disease
which afflict the body, spread steadily eastward.&nbsp; Chapel
Green with its sober, bucolic population, had made the mildest of
beginnings.&nbsp; At Mainstone half the vicar&rsquo;s
congregation thronged the chapel.&nbsp; People walked over from
Lesswardine on the Sunday evening in little laughing groups and
returned in silence with a Roman segregation of the sexes.&nbsp;
Those who scoffed had such a bad time of it that they held their
tongues.</p>
<p>Among the victims of this collective exaltation was Susie
Hind.&nbsp; No doubt the violence of her renewed passion for
Abner had thrown her into an emotional state.&nbsp; Abner was now
absorbed in it, and content to be absorbed, seeing that in this
way he purchased forgetfulness; but Susie had to run the risk of
discovery or worse until her nerves were all on edge.</p>
<p>At first Abner could not make out what was the matter with
her.&nbsp; One Sunday night she cried and cried in his arms and
would not tell him why.&nbsp; For the rest of the week she
brooded on the extremity of <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>her sin; then, with the same queer
directness that had driven her to confront Mary Malpas some time
before, she sought an interview with the evangelist and laid her
confession before him.&nbsp; He turned away from her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
cannot hear these things.&nbsp; My ears are full of them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Go and sin no more</i>!&rdquo; and remember me when you
pray.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went home burning but humiliated, and gave herself up to
an ecstasy of self-abasement in prayer.&nbsp; When the men joked
with her in the bar at night she would not listen to them.&nbsp;
Next Sunday she went again to the chapel and wept.&nbsp; She knew
that after dark that night Abner would come and call her.&nbsp;
She loved him, but it seemed to her that her immortal soul was
more precious than mortal love, and here were two souls to be
saved.&nbsp; She lay stiff in bed waiting for his signal,
compelling herself to be cold.&nbsp; A clod struck the
window-pane.&nbsp; She clasped her hands in an attitude of prayer
and lay like a stone.&nbsp; Again he signalled to her.&nbsp; She
dared not lie there any longer for fear he should become
impatient and waken her father.&nbsp; She slipped on some clothes
and came to the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see you, Abner,&rsquo; she whispered
hurriedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t let you in.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t . . . don&rsquo;t ask me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He thought she had taken leave of her senses.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What the devil&rsquo;s up with you?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She shook her head and would have closed the door on him, but
he put his foot in it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had no intention of being put off like this.&nbsp; He tried
to kiss her, but she kept him at arm&rsquo;s length, and when he
had done his best with persuasions and still could get no sense
from her, he became angry and raised his voice.&nbsp; Now genuine
fear was added to her other emotions, and in order that he should
not awaken her father she consented at last to follow him out
into the lane.&nbsp; He was on the point of agreeing when it
flashed into his mind that this was only a ruse to get him away
from the door so that she might lock it in his face.</p>
<p>The only explanation that suggested itself to him was that she
might be expecting another lover.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>you
don&rsquo;t my girl!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
come along with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He waited for her, and in another moment they had crossed the
road under the shadow of the poplar.&nbsp; From that point she
could see the roof of the cottage where the evangelist was
staying.&nbsp; The gable rose up high like a symbol of the power
she was obeying.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not here,&rsquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;We might be seen.&rsquo;&nbsp; He helped
her over the gate, taking her down in his arms.&nbsp; She
stiffened beneath his touch.&nbsp; A heavy dew had come out on
the grass that washed her ankles as she walked, for she had not
pulled on her stockings.&nbsp; Owls were hunting in the misty
starlight.&nbsp; One floated before them along the
hedgerow&mdash;ghostly on quiet wings.&nbsp; He caught her up in
his arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now what&rsquo;s it all about?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She hurried to tell him before it grew more difficult,
stammering with haste; but when she came to the story of her
conversion and her interview with Evan Hughes she felt the weight
of his ridicule overbearing her.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t humbled
herself enough to bear the indignity of being laughed at, and
least of all by Abner.&nbsp; She stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me go back!&rsquo; she said, trying to free
herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me go back!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He only held her closer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s all this havering?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up with you, eh?&nbsp; Give us a
kiss!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put her hands up to his mouth, struggling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t . . .&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took her plunge.&nbsp; &lsquo;Abner, why don&rsquo;t you
marry me?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marry you?&nbsp; Marry?&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; He
laughed out loud at the idea.</p>
<p>Then it came to him in a flash that there must be some urgent
reason for her request.&nbsp; People in his class and in that
part of the country rarely married unless they were obliged to in
accordance with the local custom.&nbsp; He had been caught in the
same way as nine out of ten of his married mates.&nbsp; It was
like his cursed luck!&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp;
His first feeling was one of bitter <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>rage.&nbsp; He saw himself tied hand
and foot, helplessly handed over to the commonest of fates,
another fool caught in the web that women spun for a free
man&rsquo;s undoing.&nbsp; He saw in front of him an endless dull
routine of life at Mainstone.&nbsp; He saw himself finished, and
the idea of paternity gave no consolation to his
bitterness.&nbsp; Then, in the same swift vision, he saw the
little household at Wolfpits that depended on him for support,
and among them the wan, devoted face of Mary Malpas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?&rsquo; he said at
last.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you know you&rsquo;re like
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She flushed in the dark, with an involuntary affectation of
modesty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How dare you?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;How dare
you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what the hell is all this talk of marrying
about?&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;What d&rsquo;you take me
for?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not that soft?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed out loud in the suddenness of his relief.&nbsp; It
stung her pride to think that he was laughing at her.&nbsp; Anger
boiled up in her, and she forgot all her pietistic resolves as
she freed herself in abuse.&nbsp; In a single second the penitent
had been turned into a virago mad with jealousy, letting fly at
him a spate of foul words that she had learned in the
taproom.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t stop to think what she was
saying.&nbsp; The words swept over her mind in a flood and made
her deaf.&nbsp; Then she saw Abner shaking with laughter at her
performance and pulled herself together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve finished with you, you great beast!&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;A dirty chap that goes running all over
the country after women!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to take turn
and turn about with a married woman, so don&rsquo;t you think
it!&nbsp; You and that great stick of a Condover as George Malpas
got sick and tired of in three year . . . you and your
Mary!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, drop that?&rsquo; said Abner darkly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Shut your mouth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drop it?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
not going to shut my mouth when the whole village is disgusted
with you and your goings on . . . and her putting on a face as
innocent as a saint and taking the children out for <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>walks, poor
little devils!&nbsp; You wait till George comes back and then
she&rsquo;ll show you the back door quick enough.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what you want taking up with a piece of muck
like that.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a dirty hypocrite, and as for her .
. .&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner stopped her mouth, but she fought and struggled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next time you&rsquo;d better go farther off than
Redlake,&rsquo; she spluttered.&nbsp; &lsquo;You dirty, rotten
swine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was lucky for her that she wrenched herself away from him,
for Abner&rsquo;s blood was in his head.&nbsp; She went running
like a madwoman over the ghostly field.&nbsp; If she had stayed
he could have murdered her.&nbsp; Slowly following, he came to
himself, and wondered what the devil he was doing in that damp
field in the middle of the night.&nbsp; He cursed all women as he
saw them in her violent image, but when he set his feet on the
high road, his anger had subsided and he began to realise how
blind he had been.&nbsp; He knew that Susie had probably spoken
no less than the truth about the local scandals.&nbsp; Looking
backward he found that he could explain the smiles and winks and
sidelong glances of his mates.&nbsp; Fine friends they were, who
made sport of a man and never told him why!&nbsp; And it dawned
on him, still stupidly incredulous, that this trouble and nothing
else was the cause of the change in Mary&rsquo;s behaviour, the
thing that had snatched her so violently away from him.&nbsp; No
doubt it had come to her ears through Mrs Mamble.&nbsp; All women
were spiteful by nature, and could not resist the pleasant
temptation of giving pain to others of their kind.&nbsp; They had
let her know in some covert way what folk were saying, and she,
too proud to confide in him, was protecting herself as best she
could.&nbsp; He knew her pride . . . he wished to God she were
not so proud, and yet, since that was her nature, he must be
patient with her.</p>
<p>He was not built for patience.&nbsp; Walking home to Wolfpits
with the high road beneath him, and the mild humming of telegraph
wires that stretched away to the ends of the earth above, he felt
once more the restlessness with which his spirit was so familiar:
the desire that had come over him in fierce gusts from time to <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>time ever
since the days of his childhood, the will to be free, to cut all
coils and launch out into the life to which he had a right.&nbsp;
Ever since his boyhood he had been as much a prisoner as George
Malpas, and for even less reason.&nbsp; Breaking free from Mawne
and reaching out over these hills, he had merely passed from one
prison to another.&nbsp; The only periods of freedom he had known
had been those dimly-remembered days with his father before Alice
came to Hackett&rsquo;s Cottages, and the week of his travels on
the road with Mick Connor.&nbsp; Always, somehow or other, a
woman had been at the bottom of his slavery.&nbsp; Women were the
curse of his existence.&nbsp; It pleased him fiercely to think
that in his breach with Susie he had shorn through one of these
shackles.&nbsp; He hated women, and yet, in his heart, he could
not remember Mary without tenderness, and knew that, however
loudly he might protest, he was going back along the road to
Wolfpits of his own free will, and whatever it might cost him,
must stay there until George Malpas returned.</p>
<p>That night he was too late to see Mary; but next morning, when
he arrived at the work, he tackled Munn on the subject of the
Redlake scandal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do they say about me and Mrs Malpas, Joe?&rsquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>Munn stammered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nowt as I know, Ab,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drop that, kid!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you come that over
me!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Spit it out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naught out of the way,&rsquo; Munn said at last.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They say as you and her is pretty thick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, they do, do they?&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And what do you think about it, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s none of my business,&rsquo; said Munn
doggedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more it is, my son,&rsquo; Abner laughed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Get on with it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They said you&rsquo;d been caught out over at
Redlake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s that bleeder Badger!&rsquo; said
Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wait till I see the sod!&nbsp; That
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear no more,&rsquo; said Munn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, kid,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;You keep
clear of the women!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you have naught to do with
them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No fear,&rsquo; said Munn, with a smirk of his
hare-lip.</p>
<p><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>Abner
had meant to have the matter out with Mary, but when he thought
it over he saw that nothing was to be gained by this.&nbsp; He
understood her awkwardness, and, knowing the delicacy of her
temper, left well alone.&nbsp; She, on her part, would have
suffered an agony of shame in showing him George&rsquo;s
letter.&nbsp; After his final interview with Susie she noticed a
change in him and wondered what had caused it.&nbsp; He began to
spend his evenings again at Wolfpits, going out to talk in the
stables with old Drew, picking baskets of fruit from the walled
garden and working, more rarely, in their own tilled plot.&nbsp;
She was curious to know what had happened, but kept her thoughts
to herself, and was grateful at least for his forbearance.</p>
<p>She had heard no more of George, and though she had lived in
fear of seeing old Mrs Malpas ever since Susie&rsquo;s visit had
told her that the new scandal was abroad, the weeks passed by and
no outside intelligence penetrated the remoteness of
Wolfpits.&nbsp; At times, when she saw Abner moving quietly about
the heavy work of the house she was overwhelmed with a sensation
which she persuaded herself was gratitude, and longed to burst
through the convention of silence or commonplace that bound
them.&nbsp; It would have been fairer, she thought, to open her
heart to him, to stand face to face without a veil between.&nbsp;
But she did not know what her own heart contained, or what the
veil concealed, and her courage always failed her.&nbsp; Not only
would her confession involve an abasement, a sacrifice of pride
that she could not face, but Heaven only knew where it might
lead.&nbsp; And yet, in spite of these things, they were almost
happy.</p>
<p>One Wednesday evening early in August, just before the gang
knocked off for the day, the clerk of the works came walking
gingerly among the scattered culverts to the trench in which
Abner and Munn were working.&nbsp; He carried a paper in his hand
which he consulted with short-sighted eyes before he addressed
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fellows and Munn, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; he
mumbled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Munn and Fellows.&nbsp; Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s us!&rsquo; said Abner, throwing down his
shovel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a letter from the boss,&rsquo; said the
clerk, &lsquo;orders <a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>to cut down the wage-bill on this
job.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to sack all supernumerary
hands&mdash;those that aren&rsquo;t regular, that is&mdash;so we
shan&rsquo;t need you two after Saturday week.&nbsp; That gives
you ten clear days&rsquo; warning to look about you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right you are, gaffer!&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>The clerk went blundering on to another trench, having ticked
off two names on his list.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Joe,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;What about
it, my son?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dunno, Ab,&rsquo; said Munn dolefully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Back to bleedin&rsquo; old Brum, I reckon.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s about the ticket.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have had
this happen not for a bit!&nbsp; I shall never find another lodge
like old Mrs Taylor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been a mother to
me, that woman!&nbsp; What are you going to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay on here, Joe,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pick
up another job somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right enough for you,&rsquo; said
Munn.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go farmerin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right enough is it?&rsquo; Abner laughed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You wait and see!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The siren sounded, and Connor came along the trench whistling
jauntily as he always did when he was up against it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Got the boot, Mick?&rsquo; Abner asked.</p>
<p>Mick nodded.&nbsp; &lsquo;It breaks the heart in me to think
I&rsquo;m afther leavin&rsquo; all them pheasants,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Off on the touch again: that&rsquo;s what
it&rsquo;s come to.&nbsp; Ireland&rsquo;s the only place to live
in, and I&rsquo;ll knock down enough for a double at Punchestown
if it&rsquo;s only hawking of dead Roses of Jericho round the
basements of Merrion Square.&nbsp; Shure, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
come along wud me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God help you, you couldn&rsquo;t be worse if you was
married&rsquo; said Mick, with a leer.</p>
<p>Abner laughed.&nbsp; He knew Mick Connor too well to take his
tongue seriously.</p>
<p>That night when he went home he did not tell Mary what had
happened, for it seemed to him his news would only disturb her
needlessly.&nbsp; At the same time he knew that something must be
done, and after tea he went down to the bridge to wait for old
Drew&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>The
labourer looked at him and scratched his head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of they casual jobs,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Money?&nbsp; Yes . . . but you never get
knowed, and there&rsquo;s nothing permanent to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner asked how he should set about finding a job in the
district, and the old man looked solemn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I rackon you&rsquo;ll find it easy enough for a month
or maybe six week with the harvest coming.&nbsp; They be glad of
any help they can get in they times.&nbsp; After that you can
whistle for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything &lsquo;ll do for me,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now mark &rsquo;ee, &rsquo;tis like this,&rsquo; the
old man explained, &lsquo;this country, when fust I know&rsquo;d
&rsquo;en, were a tarrable place for barley and wheat, but now,
like the vules they be, they&rsquo;ve a&rsquo; given it up and
gone in for this dairyin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Proper women&rsquo;s work,
I call it; and women be cheap in these parts, as they ought to
be.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say as there ban&rsquo;t the apples as
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sufficient unto the day was the evil thereof.&nbsp; Abner knew
now that he could not look beyond the harvest for regular work,
but harvest labour, being rare, was well paid, and by working
overtime he might easily amass a little store of money.&nbsp;
More than that, he might even prolong his employment, if he made
good friends, by helping to pick the yellow apples from which
thin Shropshire cider is made, but on this, he knew well, he
could not count with any certainty, as the orchards were alien
and few.&nbsp; He begged old Drew not to mention his quest to any
one at Wolfpits, and the old man blinked his assent.</p>
<p>Next Sunday evening he said good-bye to the friends who shared
in his dismissal.&nbsp; Munn, who had scraped together a little
money, was going to Ludlow, where he would catch a train for
Dulston.&nbsp; Mick Connor, being sick of England, as he said,
was tramping north to Holyhead.&nbsp; Abner walked with him to
the crest of hills above Clun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you&rsquo;re ever in the city of Dublin,&rsquo; Mick
said, &lsquo;all you&rsquo;ve got to do is to go into
Nagle&rsquo;s Back.&nbsp; Ask for the devil they call Kerry Mick,
used to lodge with Mother Muldoon, and the grocer&rsquo;s curate
&lsquo;ll give you a naggn&rsquo; for the love on him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>Abner
watched him swing away down the hill, with his loose-jointed,
loping stride.&nbsp; He returned home late at night.&nbsp; Mary,
contrary to her custom, was sitting up for him.</p>
<p>She sat at the table reading, and he quickly tumbled to her
reason for doing so.&nbsp; In the midst of his farewells he had
forgotten to give her his week&rsquo;s wages the night
before.&nbsp; She would not ask him for money; but she was hoping
that her unusual presence would make him realise what he had
forgotten.&nbsp; Seeing this he was tempted, for a moment, to
withhold it; to wait and see what she would do, to force her into
a spiritual submission; but then he remembered that the shock
which he was being forced to give her would be quite enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the brass,&rsquo; he said, placing it on
the table in front of her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Abner,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s got to go a long way this
week.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve kept none back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to be the last, far as I can
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For a second she thought that the moment had come; that her
coldness had actually forced him into leaving her.&nbsp; Remorse,
mingled with cold fear for the future, overwhelmed her; but he
saw her bewilderment and told her simply what had happened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to look out for work,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It may come along any day, only the
harvest&rsquo;s late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall have to manage,&rsquo; she said calmly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You can trust me to do the best I can.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
stood waiting as if she wanted to say something more, but at the
last her courage failed her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a few shillings
put by,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I always thought something
might happen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yo&rsquo;m a marvel and no mistake!&rsquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>During his first week of idleness Abner went out every day
visiting the farms of the neighbourhood in search of a promise of
harvest work.&nbsp; It was a lean year: the drought of the summer
had stunted the straw; a couple of violent thunderstorms had done
more harm than good, and the farmers were now hanging on as <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>long as
they dared, gambling on the chance of rain that was due.&nbsp;
Wherever Abner went they shook their heads.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say when we&rsquo;ll be cutting,&rsquo;
they said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Next week, or week after, or three
weeks&rsquo; time.&nbsp; It depends on the weather, and the
damned stuff&rsquo;s that poor it isn&rsquo;t worth
reaping.&nbsp; Worse than the hay . . . and that&rsquo;s saying
something!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At night, when he came home, Mary looked anxiously for his
news, but he could tell her nothing.&nbsp; He made casts farther
afield.&nbsp; He did not care how far he went if only he could
find work; but down in the plains, although he could see for
himself that the ears were fuller, he was met by the same evasive
replies.&nbsp; He came to hate the sight of these sour,
prosperous farmers.&nbsp; It seemed to him that they all had the
same callous faces as the distant Mr Cookson who had killed his
dog; but he knew better than to let Spider follow him on these
visits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might try Mr Prosser of The Dyke,&rsquo; said old
Drew one evening.&nbsp; &lsquo;That be a fine big farm, and they
say he do go in for barley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day Abner visited The Dyke.&nbsp; It was a farm that he
had missed in his former expeditions, a house buried in
beechwoods that stood, unappropriately, high and dry on a lofty
ridge south of the main road between Mainstone and
Lesswardine.&nbsp; It lay five miles from Wolfpits as the crow
flies, and nearly seven by road.&nbsp; A green drive bordered by
hazels and sheltered by smooth beeches in which squirrels were
playing, brought him to the house: a melancholy edifice, built
four-square, and covered with plaster that had once been painted
white but was now streaked with green.&nbsp; He knocked at the
back door, but could make nobody hear.&nbsp; A dog flew out of a
kennel near the yard gate, tugging at his chain, and inside the
house two others, excited by the sound, came pattering along the
passage and scraped at the lower edge of the door with their
paws.</p>
<p>Abner gave it up.&nbsp; Evidently nobody was at home.&nbsp; He
took a drink of cold water at the pump and set off home through
the green lane.&nbsp; Half-way down it he heard a sound of
muffled hoofs, and a dog-cart, of the sturdy kind that farmers
use, came swinging round <a name="page310"></a><span

woman of twenty-five to thirty years of age, swarthy, with a rich
autumnal colouring, and gray eyes.&nbsp; Another, younger girl,
with her hair in a pigtail, sat beside her.&nbsp; They passed
Abner at a trot, but twenty yards later the driver pulled up and
looked back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been up to The Dyke?&rsquo; she called.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, miss,&rsquo; said Abner, taking off his cap, and
approaching.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d find any one
in,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dad&rsquo;s gone to Ludlow, and
the girl&rsquo;s out.&nbsp; What do you want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came to ask if Mr Prosser wants any outside help for
harvest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him steadily.&nbsp; Their eyes met.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your
name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fellows.&nbsp; Abner Fellows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where do you live?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t belong to
these parts?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wolfpits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wolfpits?&rsquo;&nbsp; She examined him more closely,
repeating the word with an accent of surprise.&nbsp; She put a
brown-gloved finger to her lip.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think dad will
want some one: they&rsquo;re beginning the barley on
Monday,&rsquo; she said slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell you what . . .
you&rsquo;d better look up here to-morrow morning.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell dad you&rsquo;re coming.&nbsp; So
long!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She touched up the horse and the dog-cart shot forward.&nbsp;
Abner went on his way encouraged.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did you try to-day?&rsquo; Mary asked him.&nbsp;
She was doing her utmost to appear interested in his quest.&nbsp;
Indeed she could not well do less.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Up to The Dyke . . . Prosser&rsquo;s place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary blushed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you see any one
there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The place was all shut up,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I
met a young lady as I took to be Mr Prosser&rsquo;s daughter in
the drive just after I turned back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What age was she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Summat about yourn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dark?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, darkish.&nbsp; There was a young &rsquo;un along
with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How was she dressed?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>&lsquo;Now you&rsquo;m asking things out of
reason,&rsquo; Abner laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Them&rsquo;s the sort
of things a man don&rsquo;t notice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must have been Marion,&rsquo; she said, and later in
the evening she explained to him that Mr Prosser&rsquo;s elder
daughter was an old schoolfellow of hers, and rather more than a
schoolfellow, for they had once been great friends.&nbsp;
Mary&rsquo;s father, the unfortunate Condover, had been something
of a crank on the subject of education and had sent her to a
school in Ludlow, where she had mixed with all sorts of people
who were, in fact, her social superiors.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
that&rsquo;s all ages ago,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I expect
that she&rsquo;s forgotten me by now.&nbsp; Mr Prosser lost his
wife five or six years ago, and Marion&rsquo;s had charge of the
house ever since then.&nbsp; A great big place, The Dyke!&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s a queer girl, I&rsquo;ll give you my word for
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day Abner went up early to the farm.&nbsp; In the yard he
found the younger of the two girls.&nbsp; She was dressed in a
holland overall and a big straw hat and was watching a hatch of
ducklings that an anxious hen had mothered, learning to swim in
an iron bath.&nbsp; When she saw Abner she ran into the house
calling: &lsquo;Marion!&nbsp; Marion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The elder came to the door.&nbsp; Abner scarcely recognised
her, for she had changed her tweeds and her sporting hat for an
overall like that of her sister, and her dark hair was bound in
thick plaits about her head.&nbsp; She greeted him frankly,
smiling and showing between her parted lips a set of beautiful
teeth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told dad about you,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s just gone over to have a look at the bull and
&rsquo;ll be back in a minute.&nbsp; Have a glass of
cider?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner thanked her.&nbsp; She returned brightly with a mug of
cider and a plate of scones hot from the girdle.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Mr Prosser came into the yard with his
ploughman Harris.&nbsp; The farmer was a tall, fair man, with
golden whiskers and a moustache that almost hid the weakness of
his mouth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m, you&rsquo;re the young man, are you?&rsquo;
he said, looking Abner up and down with more curiosity than he
could have been expected to show for a casual labourer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What is it you want?&nbsp; Eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>Abner
repeated his request, and the farmer, with a little less than the
usual surliness of his kind, said: &lsquo;Well, yes, I dare say
we can do with you so long as you&rsquo;re not afraid of
work.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a short job, I warn you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The younger girl, who had been listening dreamily to their
conversation, turned and uttered a shrill cry.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dad!&nbsp; Dad!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
I&rsquo;ve drowned one of them!&rsquo;&nbsp; She ran forward with
an inanimate piece of yellow fluff in her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
what a shame!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s like you, Ethel,&rsquo; the father
grumbled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take it in to Marion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But by this time the elder sister had appeared and was holding
the duckling to her breast as though she would have liked to
nurse it back to life.&nbsp; Ethel stood watching her with tears
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never make a farmer&rsquo;s wife,
Ethel,&rsquo; said Mr Prosser, teasing her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
here!&nbsp; Give us a kiss!&rsquo;&nbsp; He held the
child&rsquo;s face in his hands and kissed her noisily.&nbsp;
Marion had carried the duckling into the house.&nbsp; He turned
to Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Day after to-morrow,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
up early . . . about five o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>The
Twenty-First Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the time of her Ludlow
schooldays and her friendship with Mary Condover, Marion
Prosser&rsquo;s horizon had widened to an extent that might
easily have explained the distance which now separated
them.&nbsp; From Ludlow she had been sent on to finish her
education at a Cheltenham college; for her mother had social
ambitions and knew that the nearest way to the homes of her
superiors lay through the schools that their daughters
frequented.&nbsp; She always taught Marion to speak of her father
as a &lsquo;gentleman-farmer,&rsquo; a description which Mr
Prosser accepted under more protest than he usually offered to
anything that his wife dictated.&nbsp; For all that, he was proud
of the fact that The Dyke had belonged to his family for six
generations, and when he walked round his fields on a Sunday
evening and surveyed their richness from the crumbled earthwork
of Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, which gave the farm its name, could even be
sentimental on the subject.</p>
<p>Marion went to Cheltenham when her sister Ethel was a baby two
years old.&nbsp; She made many friends, for she was good at games
and a creature of unusual spirit; but the principal feature of
her life was a sudden and passionate friendship for one of her
mistresses, a languid pre-Raphaelite young woman with a
phthisical tendency who made her read a good deal of romantic
literature of a sentimental kind.&nbsp; Miss Randall&rsquo;s
literary heroes were Parsifal and Galahad, and her fetish
personal purity, the shame-faced purity of impotence.&nbsp; She
was not fond of men, she said, although she allowed herself the
licence of a spiritual flirtation with an advanced young priest
of the Church of England, to whom she opened her soul.</p>
<p>In due course Marion&rsquo;s adoration of her mistress went
the way of all such passions; but her taste for letters
remained.&nbsp; In her eighteenth year her mother suddenly died,
and she returned to The Dyke to look after her father and her
baby sister.&nbsp; Even in the <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>excitement of her new activities she
rebelled, feeling herself isolated, alien, condemned to an
infinity of small-talk.</p>
<p>She became the hostess of her father&rsquo;s friends; farmers
of every age and type, who made love to her with varying degrees
of rustic clumsiness but seemed to Mr Prosser the most desirable
of suitors.&nbsp; Usually they drove up to The Dyke on Sunday
evenings or after Ludlow market.&nbsp; Some, by their liquorish
assumption of an easy conquest, offended her and caught the rough
side of her tongue; but she soon found that with them her genteel
shades of irony were so much waste of time, since they were not
even understood.</p>
<p>The young men retired puzzled, and their sisters sympathised
with them.&nbsp; &lsquo;She isn&rsquo;t natural,&rsquo; they
said, &lsquo;and you can&rsquo;t go against nature like
that.&nbsp; I never could think what you saw in her.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In this way Marion Prosser got a reputation for shrewishness and
conceit.&nbsp; The young men of the neighbourhood felt that even
the possession of The Dyke would be a small compensation for that
of such a difficult wife.&nbsp; They began to treat her with the
instinctive respect of the terrier for the hedge-hog, leaving her
to her books and to her fancies.</p>
<p>With these, for some years, she was content.&nbsp; The walls
of her bedroom at the Dyke showed evidences of culture in as many
strata as can be found in the coloured ribbon along the edge of a
geological map of England.&nbsp; They ranged from the primary
Rossettis of her Cheltenham period to reproductions of late
impressionist pictures.&nbsp; Among books she groped her way
determinedly.&nbsp; In Ludlow she found a branch of one of the
London circulating libraries.&nbsp; Every week she would drive
there in her pony trap and bring back the books that she had
ordered, to the amazement of the stationer who kept the
shop.&nbsp; Her father laughed at her tastes.&nbsp; Among his
friends she gained the reputation of a bluestocking, which was
enough to make any young man think twice before he spoke to
her.&nbsp; And the years went by.</p>
<p>They were dull years, and for very boredom she tried to
identify herself with the work of the farm.&nbsp; She threw
herself violently into these new interests to the <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>amazement
of her father.&nbsp; Although he was still more than a little
afraid of her, he could not help respecting her capability.&nbsp;
During the lifetime of her mother he had been so infused with the
spirit of this active woman that he had appeared to be a man of
some determination.&nbsp; Her death annihilated him: he had
relapsed into nonentity, caring nothing, as it seemed, for his
crops or his herds, driving in regularly every week to Ludlow
market like an automaton, driving back in the evening, morose and
fuddled, with no clear idea of what he had been about.&nbsp; On
these occasions he would talk piteously of his motherless girls,
and his large, sentimental eyes would fill with tears.&nbsp; He
confided to his friends that he himself was not long for this
world, though, physically, he was as strong as a horse.</p>
<p>Marion&rsquo;s determination changed all that.&nbsp; Subtly,
without his knowledge, she pulled him together and made a man of
him again, and, never having known the subjection with which her
mother had entered the estate of marriage, she did what she liked
with him, sometimes wounding his pride with her rather brutal
frankness.&nbsp; Yet, even when he was wounded, he submitted to
her; for she flattered him by pretending that he was the real
head of the household.&nbsp; At root he was a lazy man, and dared
not quarrel with his comforts.&nbsp; He realised, too, that the
knowledge of practical farming, that was as deeply rooted in him
as an instinct, was more essential to the success of their
partnership than Marion&rsquo;s acute and active mind.</p>
<p>He prospered, and in moments of exaltation would tell himself
that she was only a girl after all and that he was the man who
counted.&nbsp; He made a startling recovery of his
self-possession and talked no more of death; but his greatest
happiness he still found in the society of his younger daughter
Ethel, a child whose nature was nearer to his own.&nbsp; Some
day, he decided, Ethel should marry a solid husband of his
choosing, some big man with many lowland acres, and when the
grandchildren began to come along, he would pass a quiet old age
among them.&nbsp; Marion should have The Dyke.&nbsp; Even if she
were not the elder she had earned it.&nbsp; It seemed unlikely
that she would ever marry, being so hard to please.</p>
<p><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>Now,
at the age of twenty-eight, Marion found herself lonely.&nbsp;
The farm work had become so intimate a part of her life that it
served no longer to distract her.&nbsp; Life was slipping away
from her.&nbsp; Ten years had passed almost without her knowing
it.&nbsp; In another ten she would be nearly forty.&nbsp; A
hidden fear possessed her that by separating herself from her own
class and kind she had sacrificed the chance of living.&nbsp;
Life was the thing that mattered, and she had exchanged her
heritage for a few pitiful shreds of culture.&nbsp; The motherly
cares that she lavished on Ethel were a poor substitute for
veritable maternity, and she knew it.&nbsp; She began to see that
by refusing all commerce with the men of her own class in the
hope of realising a problematical grand passion she had
sacrificed all opportunity of passion whatever.</p>
<p>For some years after leaving Cheltenham she had exchanged
letters with a number of her college friends, but little by
little this correspondence had grown more slender and at length
it had ceased.&nbsp; In her growing apprehension she made an
attempt to revive several of these ancient friendships.&nbsp; The
result filled her with despair and vague envies.&nbsp; Most of
her girl friends were married: many of them sent her photographs
of their husbands and children.&nbsp; She alone, it seemed, of
all their company was left alone.&nbsp; It was her own
fault.&nbsp; She knew it was her own fault, for her mirror told
her that she did not show her age and that she was still
desirable.&nbsp; All things seemed to conspire in fostering her
unrest.&nbsp; The sights and sounds of the great farm around her
were full of insistence on the cycle of birth, fruitfulness, and
decay.&nbsp; Her books helped her no more.&nbsp; Her old
&aelig;sthetic idols had long since been broken, and her latest
passion, Whitman, whom she had discovered through the
anthologies, swamped her mind with an endless adoration of the
body&rsquo;s pride, the splendour of the flower no less than that
of the fruiting.</p>
<p>In this distressful and desirous state, two incidents moved
her deeply.&nbsp; The first was the dismissal of one of the farm
girls who had been seduced by a clogger and had gone into the
workhouse to have her baby.&nbsp; She was a puny, undesirable
creature, with <a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>neither beauty nor health, yet she had found a
lover.&nbsp; The second was the scandal of Mary Malpas, her old
school friend, and the young lodger at Wolfpits, rehearsed with
many winks by Mr Williams, whom her father had brought in for a
glass of whisky on a Sunday evening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A well set-up chap, that Fellows!&rsquo; said Williams
to her father.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no great wonder
she&rsquo;s took a fancy to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, &rsquo;tis the way of the world!&rsquo;
said Mr Prosser comfortably.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fill Mr
Williams&rsquo;s glass, Marion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did so, and then, furiously blushing, left the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up with your maid?&rsquo; Williams
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ve shocked her.&nbsp; Did I
say anything out of the way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not you!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a rum &rsquo;un is
Marion,&rsquo; Mr Prosser laughed.</p>
<p>And a few days later she had met Abner returning from his
fruitless visit to The Dyke.</p>
<p>She had looked at him standing bare-headed in the level
sunshine, and seen that he was well-favoured, but when she pulled
up her horse and emerged from the dream state into which the
rhythm of trotting hoofs had thrown her she had not thought that
this meeting would be different from any other with a labourer
out of work.&nbsp; She liked Abner&rsquo;s face, and for this
reason had taken the trouble to ask him where he lived.&nbsp;
Then came the word &lsquo;Wolfpits,&rsquo; and a sudden
realisation that Fellows was the name that Mr Williams had
mentioned in his scandalous tale.&nbsp; It thrilled her to find
herself face to face with Mary&rsquo;s lover.&nbsp; She lowered
her eyes, not daring to look at him, and all the time her soul
was consumed with a curiosity to see more of him, to find out
what he was like.&nbsp; She knew that this curiosity was
dangerous, that she was deliberately courting temptation, but she
had had enough of prudence and felt that she was old enough to
look after herself.&nbsp; And yet she knew that she had done a
momentous thing when she told him to call next morning at The
Dyke, and feared that trouble, indefinite trouble, might come of
it.</p>
<p>Abner had not been working three days on the farm <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>when
Harris, his principal labourer, told Mr Prosser who the new
workman was: &lsquo;Young Mrs Malpas&rsquo;s fancy man,&rsquo; he
called him; and Mr Prosser, who set great store on the
respectability of his farm, felt that he had made a mistake in
employing him.&nbsp; The matter had been settled by Marion.&nbsp;
No doubt if she had known all the circumstances of the case she
would not have taken him on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know who this young chap is, Marion?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; He comes from Wolfpits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you realise that he&rsquo;s the chap Williams was
talking about, the one that&rsquo;s living with Mary
Malpas?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I do.&nbsp; Mr Williams himself said he
didn&rsquo;t blame her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you yourself were put out a bit by his
mentioning it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put out?&nbsp; Of course I wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Why
should I be put out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s bringing the scandal rather near
home having him here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a good workman, isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with
him that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all you want to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harris doesn&rsquo;t speak well of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harris is jealous of every one who sets foot in the
place.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d think he owned it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what&rsquo;ll the vicar say?&rsquo; he joked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know nor care.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m sure
we&rsquo;re doing right to employ him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what would happen to poor Mary with that good-for-nothing Malpas
in jail and this man out of work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose you know best,&rsquo; said Mr
Prosser.&nbsp; He had not expected Marion to take the matter up
so warmly.&nbsp; And Abner stayed.</p>
<p>He was not long in finding out who was the real ruler of The
Dyke and that Mr Prosser, for all his commanding figure, stood
for nothing.&nbsp; When the men knocked off for their dinner at
midday and the two girls came down the field carrying
&lsquo;baggins&rsquo; of bread and cheese and great jugs of
harvest beer, they would wink at each other and say: &lsquo;Here
comes the boss!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>Marion scarcely ever spoke to him more than a word, but
her eyes were conscious of him, and he always felt that he was
working under her scrutiny.&nbsp; Whenever they spoke together he
was aware of the fact that it was she who had got him his job and
that she could take it away from him as easily.&nbsp; When he
came back from his work at night Mary would ask him questions
about her old friend, but he could never satisfy her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does she know that you come from here?&rsquo; she would
say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course she knows.&nbsp; I told her at the
first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she&rsquo;s never mentioned me?&nbsp; Never asked
after me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve never spoke ten words together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s funny, that!&nbsp; When you come to think of
her and me having slept in the same bed. . . .&nbsp; She must
know about me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a rum &rsquo;un, Miss Marion.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no getting away from that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He and Mary never saw much of each other in those days, for
Abner had to get up very early in the morning in time for his
seven mile walk, and the harvest labour was severe.&nbsp; Severe,
and yet pleasant, for the summer weather held and no rain
fell.&nbsp; The sun shone pitilessly on the whitening stubbles,
but the corn-fields of The Dyke were so lifted upon the back of
the hills that they seemed to be part of a high cloudland and
free from all heaviness.&nbsp; On the lower levels the whir of
reaping machines might be heard, but higher up the fields were so
unlevel, following the broken contour of the hills and bounded by
the sloping ramparts of the dyke, that all the reaping must be
done with sickles and the dry shocks carried to the head of a
rough road.&nbsp; Abner had not the skill to wield a sickle, and
so in this part of the labour he was useless.&nbsp; Harris, the
labourer, who acted as foreman when Mr Prosser was not in the
fields, resented this.&nbsp; Before Marion&rsquo;s interest in
the farm began he had been his master&rsquo;s right-hand
man.&nbsp; He had been present at the time when Abner was first
employed by Mr Prosser, and knowing that the newcomer was a
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Miss Marion&rsquo;s, was naturally
jealous.&nbsp; When the men sat in the shade of a hedgerow for
lunch he grumbled to his mates and grudged Abner his share <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>of the
food.&nbsp; The two casual labourers were inclined to take
Harris&rsquo;s side; but old Avery, a man of sixty who had worked
at The Dyke all his life, stood up for Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the place is coming to,&rsquo;
Harris said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want no navvies
here.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s too many about as it is.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a farming man&rsquo;s job, reaping.&nbsp; I reckon
you&rsquo;re one of Miss Marion&rsquo;s fancies.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d a&rsquo; better look out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The men laughed, and Abner asked him what the hell he
meant.</p>
<p>Harris was a dangerous-looking customer for all his years,
strong as a bull, with a low, ape-like forehead, badger-gray
hair, and long, ungainly arms that seemed to have been bowed by
the carrying of trusses of hay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know what I mean,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want no
bleedin&rsquo; outsiders here, snatching the bread out of our
mouths.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Violence would surely have followed, but at the most dangerous
moment the farmer and his daughters arrived.&nbsp; The reaping of
the twelve-acre field was almost finished, a huge expanse of
stubble lay gleaming under the noon-day sun, and crackled with
heat.&nbsp; In the midst of the field a square of barley stood
unreaped and shimmering, and within it cowered a secret multitude
of field-mice, hares, and rabbits that the destruction of their
homes had driven inwards.&nbsp; Mr Prosser and Marion carried
guns, and Ethel was playing with three dogs that sniffed and
trembled with eagerness for this annual pastime of slaughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Harris, let&rsquo;s get a move on!&rsquo; said the
farmer.</p>
<p>The horses, that had stood stamping and swishing their tails
and flicking flies from their ears in the shade of an elder-bush,
were brought round with cries of encouragement, and the machine
rolled clanking over the stubble towards the standing corn.&nbsp;
Prosser and his daughters stayed behind in the hedgerow, the
day&rsquo;s work went on, and as the square diminished, narrowing
with each turn of the machine, the dogs sniffed along the edge of
that narrow sanctuary until the guns were ready.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give Miss Marion a hand with her loading,
Fellows,&rsquo; Prosser shouted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell the men to get
their sticks <a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>ready, Harris, and we&rsquo;ll put the dogs in on the
far side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner and Marion stood together with the sun beating on their
backs.&nbsp; The dogs ran barking into the corn.&nbsp; Above
them, in the eye of the sun, a kestrel hovered.&nbsp; Three
frightened rabbits bolted from the farther edge.&nbsp; Prosser
fired two barrels and killed one.&nbsp; Another was wounded, and
Harris ran after it with ungainly strides and stick
uplifted.&nbsp; He brought down the stick with a savage cry and
dashed out the animal&rsquo;s brains.&nbsp; &lsquo;I got him, the
varmint!&rsquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>The multitude within the square of corn trembled.&nbsp; One by
one, terror drove them out into the open.&nbsp; Marion fired
twice and missed.&nbsp; Her hands shook as she gave the gun to
Abner to reload.&nbsp; She could not see her pitiful target; she
saw nothing but the young man at her side with his sun-bleached
hair, his red chest and neck, and the milk-white skin above the
roll of his shirt sleeves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quick!&nbsp; You&rsquo;m missing of them!&rsquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>She fired again, and missed.&nbsp; She could hit nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with
me,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ve been too
long in the sun.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better take the gun
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she stood watching the sureness of his aim as he fired,
knocking over the pitiful, bright-eyed, furry creatures one by
one.&nbsp; She watched him, fascinated, conscious only of his
health and strength and the perfect co-ordination of his
body.&nbsp; She saw it as that of her friend&rsquo;s lover, and
in a yearning tenderness she thought of that hidden life away in
Wolfpits.&nbsp; She could stand it no longer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me the gun,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took the weapon from him and went over to join her sister
in the hedge, where she sat watching the scene of slaughter in a
dream.&nbsp; Then she got up suddenly, telling Ethel that the sun
was too much for her, and went straight home to her
bedroom.&nbsp; All afternoon she lay on her bed in the green
light of a venetian blind.&nbsp; Her eyes burned and her head was
splitting, but she knew that this was not altogether because of
the sun.&nbsp; Later, when she had bathed her eyes in cold <a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>water and
done her hair, she pulled out an old album in which there was a
photograph taken at the Ludlow school where Mary Malpas had been
her friend.&nbsp; It was a group ranged round the central figures
of the two precise spinsters who kept the academy.&nbsp; She and
Mary Condover were standing side by side: two solemn,
self-conscious, childish faces with eyes staring straight at the
photographer.&nbsp; Now Mary Condover was Mary Malpas, and had
this man for a lover.&nbsp; Over in the secrecy of Wolfpits they
loved.&nbsp; Ethel came knocking at the door with a cup of
tea.&nbsp; The sound of her knock made Marion jump.&nbsp; It was
not like her to be nervous.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve counted the rabbits,&rsquo; said
Ethel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thirty-two!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s two more than
last year.&nbsp; Dad&rsquo;s ever so pleased.&nbsp; Is your
headache better?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m all right,&rsquo; said Marion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be down in a minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For several days she saw next to nothing of Abner.&nbsp; One
morning, however, her father sent him up to her with a
message.&nbsp; She was making pastry in the kitchen; her hands
and arms were white with flour and the heat of the range had
flushed her face.&nbsp; Again she found that in his presence she
lost her self-possession, and falling on an awkward silence she
blurted out:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, how does it suit you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well enough,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thanks to
you, miss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t thank <i>me</i>!&rsquo; she said, with
a laugh.</p>
<p>He was going, but she called him back to the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you find the walk to Wolfpits rather
tiring?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a fair step,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t take much count of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay up here till harvest&rsquo;s
over?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You could make up some sort
of a bed in the loft.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He thanked her, but refused.&nbsp; &lsquo;I find a good bit to
do when I get home nights,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
can&rsquo;t get on in the house without me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They?&rsquo; she said, with a laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,
well, it won&rsquo;t be for long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While they were speaking together at the door Harris <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>passed them
with his basket slung over his stooping shoulders.&nbsp; He
touched his cap to Marion, and gave Abner a wry smile as he
passed.&nbsp; Marion returned to the kitchen without another
word, and Abner, on his way back to the field began to puzzle his
head as to what she had meant by her sudden change of front when
he had excused himself from sleeping at The Dyke.&nbsp; The scorn
that she had put into her repetition of the word
&lsquo;they&rsquo; made him think that perhaps there was more
justification than he had imagined in Mary&rsquo;s feeling of
resentment against Marion Prosser.&nbsp; But if she felt sore
with Mary for any reason, there was no need for her to practise
on him.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t going to be lugged in to any petty
feminine quarrel, they might be sure of that!&nbsp; He had quite
enough to do on his own keeping even with that leering devil
Harris.&nbsp; Mr Harris was going to cop it one of these days,
and no mistake!</p>
<p>He dismissed Marion Prosser from his mind.&nbsp; And yet, all
through the hot harvest season the two of them were meeting and
passing with a sense of something desired but unspoken on the
part of Marion; and whenever they met there came into
Abner&rsquo;s mind a grudging recognition of her physical
presence.&nbsp; He decided that he did not like this strong,
dark, almost boyish creature who, without even speaking, could so
thrust herself upon his consciousness.&nbsp; She was too secret
for him.&nbsp; He wished that she would speak out what she had to
say so that they might know where they were and be finished with
it, and since she would not do so he avoided her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the harvest season was drawing to a close.&nbsp; The
later crops were marred by the long-awaited rain.&nbsp; From
every corner of the uplands came the same story: straw so weak as
to be worthless and wheat sprouting in the ear.&nbsp; Prosser,
who could well stand these losses and many more, picked up an
infection of grumbling at the Ludlow market ordinary.&nbsp; Not
only were the standing crops ruined but the extra hands were
eating their heads off.&nbsp; Harris echoed his lamentations, and
Abner, together with the two other outsiders who had been engaged
for the harvest, would have been paid off but for the
intervention of Marion.</p>
<p><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>He
knew nothing of this.&nbsp; Through all that dead, wet season,
when the baked hill-sides steamed with rain and morning skies
were heavy with autumnal mist, he busied himself with odd jobs
about the farm.&nbsp; It was important for him if he were to find
work in the neighbourhood when the job at The Dyke was over, that
he should learn as much as he could of the farm-labourer&rsquo;s
craft.&nbsp; He learned to milk, to brush the horses and to bed
them down, helped with the lifting of the main-crop potatoes and
dug them into the immense buries, shaped like the barrows of the
stone-men on Castel Ditches, in which they were stored for
winter.</p>
<p>Then, sudden, unheralded, came a September summer.&nbsp; The
mists disappeared; the drowned crops stood up golden in a hot and
level sunshine; the work of the fields began again.&nbsp; They
laboured incessantly, for the sunshine and drought were now more
precious than gold.&nbsp; They worked so hard from the light of
dawn until the stunted sheaves threw gigantic shadows, that there
was no room in his mind for the foibles of Marion or the growing
jealousy of Harris.&nbsp; Prosser and his girls came down into
the fields to aid them.&nbsp; The sheaves ripened against time,
and Prosser watched the sky and tapped his glass all day
long.&nbsp; He held on as long as he dared; but on the eighth day
of the drought the glass began to fall, and the last sheaves were
carted from the fields by moonlight.</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock in the morning they knocked off,
exhausted, and strangely happy in the consciousness of a work
well done; but the sense of happiness departed from Abner as he
walked home through the owl-haunted twilight, for he knew that
the job at The Dyke was over, and he had nothing else before
him.&nbsp; At the end of the week, he supposed, he would draw his
money and be faced with a new search for employment.</p>
<p>Next day, in accordance with the ancient custom of The Dyke, a
harvest home was held in the long kitchen of the house.&nbsp; All
morning Marion, her sister, and Agnes the maid were busy baking
cakes and boiling hams for the festival.&nbsp; The wives and
children of the labourers were asked to share in these
rejoicings, and more than twenty usually sat down to the long
table <a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>at
night.&nbsp; Abner and the other extra hands were expected to
come, but Mary Malpas was not invited.</p>
<p>Abner saw nothing strange or pointed in the omission, and
indeed he had no time to spare for ceremonies of this kind,
having been bred in a country where feudal customs had long since
died away under the new and harder influence of capitalism.&nbsp;
But to the labourers at The Dyke, and particularly to older men
such as Daniel Avery, the harvest home was a feast as religious
as any ancient mystery.&nbsp; To them it was the crown of the
year and its labours, more vital and more significant than any
convention of the calendar.&nbsp; Mr Prosser, as a member of the
older generation, was himself attached to the custom.&nbsp; It
reminded him of his boyhood, of the days when his father was
master of The Dyke and his grandfather sat watching the dances
from the chimney corner, and in this way it comforted him with a
sense of continuity and flattered those vestiges of family pride
which were the deepest elements in his nature.&nbsp; The day
always found him in the best of spirits, and Marion, who loved to
see her father made happy even by the simplest things, caught a
little of his joyful infection.&nbsp; The house was in a stir;
the servants laughed and sang about their work; the oaken dresser
was spread with holiday fare.&nbsp; Marion caught old Avery in
the yard and made him promise to sing his mole-catcher&rsquo;s
song.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I do sing it, I mun sing it right through,&rsquo;
said the old man, with a wink.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t mind
the verses without I sing them in arder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughed; for many of his verses were indecent.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You shall sing just what you like, Dan,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; As well quarrel with the indecency of the Bible as
that of Avery&rsquo;s songs.</p>
<p>Mr Prosser had told the men to leave their work at five
o&rsquo;clock instead of at six, in order that they might go home
to clean themselves and fetch their families.&nbsp; Only Hayes,
the cowman, who slept on the premises, was to be left
behind.&nbsp; Abner, old Avery, and Harris set off down the drive
together.&nbsp; The others moved too slowly for Abner, for he had
seven miles in front of him.&nbsp; All day long Harris had taken
a malicious pleasure <a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>in letting Abner know that his time
was up and that The Dyke would soon be shut of him.&nbsp; There
had been one or two ugly moments, softened by the good humour of
old Dan.&nbsp; Now they walked alongside in silence, Abner
setting the pace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey, you do go too fast for old bones, my son!&rsquo;
said Avery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wants to get home to his missus,&rsquo; said
Harris.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, you&rsquo;d better drop that!&rsquo; said Abner
warningly.</p>
<p>But Harris would not be warned.&nbsp; He knew, as well as the
others, that Mary Malpas had not been invited to The Dyke.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I reckon you&rsquo;m going to leave her behind
to-night,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d better mind your own
business.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a damn sight too much of your
lip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harris laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stands to reason they won&rsquo;t
have that kind of muck in the company of decent married women and
innocent childer,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Abner did not wait to answer him.&nbsp; He let out with his
right, catching Harris on the temple, and sent him spinning
toward the ditch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Steady, lad, steady!&rsquo; cried old Avery.</p>
<p>Harris pulled himself together and made straight for Abner
with his head low down like a bull.&nbsp; He was the older man,
and, in spite of the iron strength of his arms, Abner always had
the advantage.&nbsp; Harris fought desperately with his
hob-nailed boots as well as his fists.&nbsp; They fought till
their faces were bloody and their clothes torn.&nbsp; Old Avery
whined at them to give over, but they took no notice of
him.&nbsp; At last Abner drove Harris into the ditch, where he
lay spluttering blood.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon that&rsquo;ll teach
you to keep your bleedin&rsquo; mouth shut!&rsquo; said Abner
savagely, and left him there with the old man trembling and
shedding weak tears above him.</p>
<p>He washed in the Folly Brook and had made himself fairly
presentable by the time he reached Wolfpits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you were going to the harvest home,&rsquo;
said Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you thought wrong,&rsquo; said Abner
irritably.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give us some tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neither Harris nor his family turned up at The Dyke that
evening.&nbsp; Old Dan, who had kept his own counsel, <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>was in the
middle of his mole-catching song when one of the
ploughman&rsquo;s children came in with a message to say that her
dad was in a fever, and the bed wringing wet under him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t your mother come?&rsquo; Prosser
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dad wouldn&rsquo;t let her,&rsquo; said the child.</p>
<p>Marion took her aside and gave her a piece of cake.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It never rains but it pours,&rsquo; Prosser
grumbled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s Harris badly, and now Hayes
tells me he&rsquo;s got a poisoned finger.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what we&rsquo;ll do for the milking to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s Fellows,&rsquo; said Marion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s lucky we&rsquo;ve got him.&nbsp; Why,
he isn&rsquo;t here either!&nbsp; What the devil&rsquo;s the
matter with them all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marion said nothing.&nbsp; She had guessed long ago why Abner
was not there.&nbsp; She had half suspected that he would not
come to The Dyke without Mary, but her pride would not let her
ask her father to invite the family from Wolfpits.&nbsp; In the
bottom of her heart she doubted if she would dare to meet her old
friend.&nbsp; It would be so difficult, and besides that she felt
that the intuitions of the other woman might discover her own
leaning toward Abner.&nbsp; It was too dangerous.</p>
<p>Next morning Abner arrived at his usual hour.&nbsp; During the
night Dr Hendrie had been summoned to The Dyke and had found that
the neglected splinter in the cowman&rsquo;s finger threatened
him with blood-poisoning, and the loss of his arm.&nbsp; At dawn
Mr Prosser had driven him in to the infirmary at
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Marion received Abner on his arrival.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come up last night?&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That sort of thing bain&rsquo;t much in my line,&rsquo;
he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted you to come,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>He only smiled awkwardly, and she wished that she had been
more prudent.&nbsp; She told him that Hayes was in hospital and
that Harris was laid up with influenza.&nbsp; It would be a
convenience to them if he could take over Hayes&rsquo;s work,
which was the care and milking of the cows and the driving of
milk-cans morning and night to Llandwlas station.&nbsp; He was
astonished at this turn of luck, for he had expected to be
dismissed with his <a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>harvest earnings in his pocket.&nbsp; For all that, he
didn&rsquo;t mean to take the job on false pretences.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So Harris has caught the influenza, has he?&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he sent up his little girl with a message last
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it wasn&rsquo;t
true.&nbsp; What Harris got was a damned good hammering from
me&mdash;one that he won&rsquo;t forget.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She thrilled to hear him.&nbsp; In her eyes he had become a
hero.&nbsp; She knew already that he could be gentle.&nbsp; It
gave her a curious, almost physical pleasure to realise him as a
fighting man, for every one in the district was aware of
Harris&rsquo;s iron strength.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me what happened,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He only got what he asked for,&rsquo; said Abner,
&lsquo;with his dirty talk about young Mrs Malpas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary Malpas . . .&rsquo; she said quickly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sick of hearing her name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not pass on to her father what Abner had told
her.&nbsp; He came back from Shrewsbury that evening tired and
depressed.&nbsp; &lsquo;The doctors reckon that we were only just
in time with poor Hayes,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
a near shave for his left arm.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve had to open it
right up to the shoulder and he&rsquo;ll be lucky if he&rsquo;s
out of hospital by Christmas.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what we
can do, with Harris ill as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s Fellows,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s Fellows,&rsquo; he repeated,
thinking of other things.&nbsp; He stared at her vaguely, but it
seemed to her that his eyes were searching her, and she left him,
blushing.</p>
<p>Abner&rsquo;s new work kept him almost exclusively on the farm
premises, and for this reason he and Marion often crossed each
other&rsquo;s paths.&nbsp; They met so often that Marion lost a
little of her shame in speaking with him.&nbsp; She handled him
cleverly, so that in the end he lost a good deal of the
awkwardness that she herself had created.&nbsp; She was frank and
kind, helping him in many small things.&nbsp; He came to take her
for granted, and even to like her.&nbsp; In a little time he
became accustomed to the cowman&rsquo;s job and took a pride in
it.&nbsp; To all intents <a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>and purposes he was his own master;
for the dairy was Marion&rsquo;s province, and Mr Prosser rarely
interfered with its management.</p>
<p>Within a week of his hammering, Harris returned, apparently
not much the worse for it.&nbsp; Nobody but old Avery knew what
had happened, and the ploughman kept to himself a story that was
hardly flattering.&nbsp; Abner had been prepared to treat him
friendlily; but he soon saw that Harris had no intention of doing
the same, maintaining a surly silence that was never to be
broken, since their work now lay in different directions.</p>
<p>So autumn passed, the first frosts of winter whitened the
upland, and the first ploughing began.&nbsp; Abner kept to his
own work.&nbsp; The Prossers&rsquo; dairy was a small one, for
their pasture land was limited, but he found that with the two
station deliveries, the milking, and the care of the cows, his
hands were pretty full.&nbsp; He saw less and less of Wolfpits,
for it had been arranged that he should take his evening meal at
the farm on his return from the station, and Mary was not
altogether sorry for this, since it freed her from many
embarrassing moments.</p>
<p>Abner was now earning a good wage, and the household was
relatively prosperous.&nbsp; He was even able to replace the
watch that had been stolen at Bran.&nbsp; In this peaceful
interlude the only thing that really disquieted Mary&rsquo;s mind
was George&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; She had never yet dared to show
it to Abner, but she had not destroyed it, and from time to time
a cruel fascination compelled her to take it from the drawer
where she had hidden it and to read it again.&nbsp; It seemed
strange to her that she had received no other word from
him.&nbsp; If he could write once he could surely write again,
and though she did not dare to confide its contents to Mrs
Mamble, she induced the old woman to question the wife of a
policeman at Lesswardine whom she had attended in a confinement
as to the conditions under which a prisoner in the county jail
might receive visitors or write letters.&nbsp; A prisoner in
George&rsquo;s condition, Mrs Mamble told her, was entirely
separated from the outside world for the first three months of
his sentence.&nbsp; After that, if his conduct were good, he
might write and receive one letter every month, and invite one
visitor to see <a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>him during the same period.&nbsp; This knowledge amazed
her; for George had now been in jail more than nine months but
had only written her this one, disturbing letter and had never
once asked her to visit him.&nbsp; The fact filled her with an
inexplicable pang of jealousy; but what troubled her more deeply
was to know that Mrs Mamble was conscious of her humiliation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The less you think about him the better,&rsquo; said
the old woman stoutly.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was never no good to you,
and never will be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Mary could not put the matter out of her mind.&nbsp; Once
again she commissioned Mrs Mamble to make inquiries in Chapel
Green and find out if old Mrs Malpas had visited George in
prison.&nbsp; The answer was definite.&nbsp; Mrs Malpas had never
left the village since the day of the trial, although she had
received several letters from George, as the postman, who lodged
with one of Mrs Mamble&rsquo;s friends, could vouch.</p>
<p>Then Mary hardened her heart; for she guessed that George was
choosing for his only visitor the widow woman from Lesswardine,
whom she had seen at the trial.&nbsp; Re-reading George&rsquo;s
letter she burned with anger.&nbsp; What right had he to dictate
to her how she should behave?&nbsp; Her soul was full of hatred
and contempt, so that she almost wished that she had given him
real cause for suspicion.&nbsp; In this state she allowed her
memory to dwell with tenderness on the surprising moment that had
come to her and Abner by the sea-crows&rsquo; pool.&nbsp; She
felt that she had been foolish to shrink from it.&nbsp; And yet
she dared not let Abner see what she was thinking; knowing for
certain, that if she did so something violent and terrible must
happen to them.&nbsp; For herself she had no fear; but the
thought of what the children might suffer chilled her.&nbsp; And
she released her surfeit of feeling in a more passionate devotion
to these small creatures, determining, whatever might happen, to
hold on for the remaining eight months of George&rsquo;s
imprisonment.&nbsp; This artificial resolution made her harden
herself more than ever against Abner.</p>
<p>One day Mrs Mamble brought her the news that Susan Hind was
being married in less than a week to Badger, the keeper.&nbsp;
She now saw so little of Abner that she <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>could not
be sure that his old relations with Susie had ceased, but she
found herself snatching eagerly at an occasion for wounding
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;re going to your old friend&rsquo;s
wedding, Abner,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about one,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no friends in these parts that I
know to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Susie Hind . . . she&rsquo;s marrying Mr Badger next
Monday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She watched him carefully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he&rsquo;s welcome!&rsquo; said Abner, with a
laugh.</p>
<p>And then, instead of being relieved, she found herself
overwhelmed by a new suspicion.&nbsp; He would not have spoken
like that unless he had been entangled with some other
woman.&nbsp; She wondered who it could be, and a few days later
began to ply him with deliberate questions about Marion
Prosser.&nbsp; He did not guess what she was driving at; imagined
that she was still brooding over her old slight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know naught about her,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you like her any better than you did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind her,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;At any rate she don&rsquo;t werrit me with questions about
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day in October Marion renewed her proposal that Abner
should sleep at The Dyke.&nbsp; She told him that she
didn&rsquo;t like to think of him walking to and from Wolfpits
every day.&nbsp; If she had substituted &lsquo;Mary Malpas&rsquo;
for &lsquo;Wolfpits&rsquo; she would have been nearer to the
truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can make you quite comfortable in the little loft
above the harness-room,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no point in your wearing yourself
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said nothing; but told Mary of her proposal.&nbsp;
Listening, she held her breath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to keep you,&rsquo; she compelled
herself to say.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No fear!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
catch me losing my liberty that way!&nbsp; A man that sleeps over
his work&rsquo;s no better than a slave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She felt a sudden relief.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re quite
right,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re
right.&rsquo;&nbsp; She spoke as if it were the matter of
principle that interested her.</p>
<p><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>Next
day he refused Marion&rsquo;s offer, and she left him in a
huff.&nbsp; She was miserable, for she could not overcome the
attraction which he had exercised over her from the first, yet
was too bashful to declare herself more openly.&nbsp; She tried
to tell herself that Abner was only a labouring man and her
inferior in station, but she could not pretend that physically he
was not her equal, nor deny his influence.&nbsp; She hoped that
he would notice the change in her attitude, see that she was
avoiding him, and, perhaps, miss her; but he went on with his
work as usual and did not seem to care whether she came near him
or sent him messages by Ethel or Agnes, the maid, and so,
gradually, with a feeling of shame, she was driven back to his
company.</p>
<p>The days were now drawing in rapidly, and it was after sunset
when the cows came to be milked.&nbsp; It had been Marion&rsquo;s
custom to carry the scoured pails to the byre and stand by
Abner&rsquo;s side while he milked.&nbsp; When he drove the cows
into the shed he would light a stable lantern and hang it from a
nail in the wall before he found his stool and took the pail from
her hands.&nbsp; These were the moments when she felt herself
nearest to him.&nbsp; Standing in the doorway of the shippon she
would watch him as he sat with his fair head pressed to the
cows&rsquo; flanks and listen to the milk swishing into the
pails.&nbsp; It was a moment of most soothing silence.&nbsp;
Neither of them spoke, nor was there any other sound but that of
the cows snatching hay from the racks above them with their lips
and filling the shed with their sweet breath.&nbsp; Marion stood
very still in that slow-breathing quietude, and thither, like
shadows, came the cats that lived in the lofts and roofs of the
granary, shy, half-savage creatures.&nbsp; It was part of
Abner&rsquo;s ritual to set a tin basin of milk frothing-warm on
the floor for them, and round this they would walk, five or six
of them, with sidelong gait and tails uplifted.&nbsp; Every night
at milking-time they came.&nbsp; But if she stirred a muscle they
were gone.&nbsp; She watched them, quiet, hallucinated; and when
they were gone she stayed on in the silence, while Abner strained
the milk into her scalded buckets and passed from stall to
stall.</p>
<p>One evening she found him troubled.</p>
<p><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t half like the look of Daisy
here,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Daisy was a red Devon cow, the only one of her breed in
Prosser&rsquo;s herd of white-nosed Herefords.&nbsp; Some weeks
before she had calved; but the calf had been feeble and had died,
and though they had given her a calf-skin stuffed with straw to
lick she had pined, and the milk had failed in quality.&nbsp; Now
she stood miserably in her stall with her ears turned back and
her sleek coat staring.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s wrong with her?&rsquo; Marion
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was coughing a good bit when I drove her
in&mdash;seemed to have no heart in her either&mdash;and you can
see she&rsquo;s breathing quicker than the others.&nbsp; You put
your ear to her and hearken.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like a lot of
bubbles going off inside of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He put his arm over the animal&rsquo;s neck and
listened.&nbsp; Marion did as he told her.&nbsp; They listened
together, but she could hear nothing but Abner&rsquo;s own deep,
placid breath.&nbsp; He seemed very near to her.&nbsp; She could
see his serious eyes shining with pin-points of
lantern-light.&nbsp; Her heart began to beat so violently that
she feared he must hear it.&nbsp; She felt a choking sensation in
her breast, as though her heart was bursting and she must cry out
or weep.&nbsp; It was intolerable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you catch it?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I hear,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I reckon she&rsquo;s worse than she seemed,&rsquo; said
Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think she&rsquo;s got the bronchitis.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d best let the gaffer know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone down to Craven Arms for the sales
to-morrow,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s booked a
bed at the Railway Hotel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like our luck!&rsquo; Abner grumbled.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better give her a drench of gruel and
poultice her when we&rsquo;ve finished the milk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he came back from the station she was ready with a
draught of oatmeal gruel.&nbsp; Then she set herself to making a
poultice of linseed meal and brought it out to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I reckon I can&rsquo;t leave her to-night,&rsquo; he
told her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better send for Harris?&rsquo; she
asked.</p>
<p><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>He
flared up at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;Harris?&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want that Harris poking his nose in my
shippon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; she said mildly.&nbsp; She watched
him adjust the poultice over Daisy&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; The
animal was now coughing painfully, and the chill of the night air
seemed to strangle her breathing.&nbsp; Marion found it difficult
to leave him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no call for you to go catching your death
of cold,&rsquo; Abner said.</p>
<p>Again she submitted.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I think we&rsquo;d
better take turns with her,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and tell Agnes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She left him, and though she could not persuade him to let her
take his place she returned from time to time to the byre.&nbsp;
He scarcely spoke to her, for the animal&rsquo;s condition made
him more and more anxious.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock in the
morning she came out in her dressing-gown with her dark hair
braided down her back for the night.&nbsp; The cow was now a
terrible sight.&nbsp; She had sunk down upon the floor of the
shed and was breathing in desperate, quick gasps, with her brown
eyes piteously upturned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the look of her,&rsquo; said Abner,
&lsquo;not half.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall have to send for Harris.&nbsp; He understands
them,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; he returned, grudgingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send Agnes down to the village.&nbsp; And
then I&rsquo;ll bring you some tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Agnes is making it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sent the maid running off at once.&nbsp; The kitchen fire
was nearly out and the kettle would not boil.&nbsp; It seemed to
her an age before she could get it boiling.&nbsp; Then she filled
a jug with tea and prepared to take it to him.&nbsp; At the door
a shadow startled her and she gave a cry.&nbsp; Abner was
standing on the step.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bad job,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; She went off quite
sudden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not realise what he was saying.&nbsp; She gave a
nervous laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, what a start you gave me!&rsquo; she said, putting
down the jug on the table.&nbsp; And then, suddenly, she put her
hands to her face and started sobbing hysterically.</p>
<p><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t take on like that!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no fault of yourn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not that!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He put his hand on her shoulder, trying to soothe her, and the
next moment she was clinging in his arms and he was covering her
face and neck with kisses.&nbsp; Harris, who had run up from his
cottage as fast as he could travel, stood panting and gazing at
them in the doorway, but neither Abner nor Marion saw him, and
when he had stared at them for a moment he moved quietly across
the yard into the byre.</p>
<h2><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>The
Twenty-Second Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr Prosser returned from
Craven Arms next evening he was in a bad temper.&nbsp; At the
Railway Hotel on the night before he had fallen in with a number
of cattle dealers from North Bromwich and Manchester.&nbsp; He
had drunk more than he could stand, and had sat up playing cards
in the commercial room till three o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
losing the price of a bullock in the process.&nbsp; Marion, who
met him at Llandwlas station, told him that the Devon cow had
died in the night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Died?&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what do you mean
&ldquo;died&rdquo;?&nbsp; She was all right yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fellows says it was bronchitis.&nbsp; It was awful to
see her breathing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bronchitis!&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t die that quick with
bronchitis.&nbsp; What the hell does Fellows know about
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have done more than he did,&rsquo;
she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;He sat up with her till she
went.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never known such an unlucky year,&rsquo; he
grumbled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hayes&rsquo;s wife says that he
won&rsquo;t be out of hospital for another month or more.&nbsp;
Fellows means well enough, but he&rsquo;s not like an experienced
cowman.&rsquo;&nbsp; He sat broodily in the trap for a few
moments.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you send for
Harris?&rsquo; he asked at length.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We did, but Daisy died before he could get
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall advertise for a cowman,&rsquo; he said, with a
show of determination that gave him a better opinion of
himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fellows did his best.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t his
fault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you know about it, anyway?&rsquo; said Mr
Prosser roughly.</p>
<p>Reaching The Dyke in the worst of tempers, he had not even
time to give Ethel the kiss for which she stood waiting.&nbsp; He
went straight into the dining-room and mixed himself a stiff
whisky and water, then, feeling masterful and businesslike, he
went straight out into the fields to look for Harris.&nbsp; He
found him driving in his team from the plough.</p>
<p><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>&lsquo;Did you see Daisy last night?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I see&rsquo;d her, but not afore she was wellnigh
cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did she come to go off sudden like that,
eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you want to know what I thinks, Mr Prosser,
I&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp; That cow she died of violent
neglect.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had my eye on her some days
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why the devil didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me and Fellows don&rsquo;t speak to one another, and
you was gone off to the sales.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell Miss Marion, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good talking to Miss Marion about
he.&nbsp; Her wouldn&rsquo;t hear a word against Fellows, though
he be no more fit to look after cows than rabbits, and I know for
why.&rsquo;&nbsp; Harris shook his head knowingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by that?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you
speak plain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I will speak plain, Mr Prosser, though I
don&rsquo;t know where your eyes have been if you haven&rsquo;t
seed it for yourself.&nbsp; Miss Marion&rsquo;s soft on that
Fellows, and he knows it and takes advantage on it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prosser gave an uneasy laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t get
me to believe that,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can believe it or not, gaffer,&rsquo; said
Harris.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m only telling you of what I knows, and what I&rsquo;ve
seen with my own eyes.&nbsp; When Daisy was dying that Fellows
was in your own kitchen and the two of them kissing one another,
so took up they never saw me coming.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the
truth, as I&rsquo;m standing here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prosser could only stare at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ought to have known the name that chap has with
women.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Mr Hind&rsquo;s daughter over at the
Pound House; there&rsquo;s George Malpas&rsquo;s wife, not
counting those that was never found out.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
proper young bull, that Fellows, and no mistake!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The farmer left him in a fury.&nbsp; He found Marion laying
the supper-table in the dining-room.&nbsp; Ethel was crouched by
the fire reading a book of fairy-tales.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You go out into the kitchen, Ethel,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want to talk to Marion.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so comfy here, dad,&rsquo; said the
child sleepily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do as you&rsquo;re bid!&rsquo; he shouted, and Ethel,
frightened, left the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve scared her,&rsquo; said Marion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s not used to being spoken to like
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and it &rsquo;ld be better
for the both of you if you were.&nbsp; Just you put those things
down and tell me the truth about Fellows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, father?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you he did all he could.&nbsp; He sat up
with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that&rsquo;s a damned lie to start with!&nbsp; Sat
up with her, did he?&nbsp; Sat up spooning in the kitchen along
with you.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s more like it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She blushed, then straightened herself and faced him with her
hands clasped before her.&nbsp; He was almost frightened of her
burning eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who told you that?&rsquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never you mind who told me.&nbsp; They that told me saw
it with their own eyes.&nbsp; Saw you behaving like a
labourer&rsquo;s girl in a hedge.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a fine thing
to come to!&nbsp; You deny it if you can!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to deny it,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ve no shame left in you.&nbsp; Thank God
your poor mother hasn&rsquo;t lived to see it!&nbsp; I never
thought to hear a daughter of mine speak like that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He waited for her to defend herself; but she stood as though
petrified, cold, with a furnace of emotions flaming inside
her.&nbsp; He took her by the arm, roughly, and shook her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t dad!&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, tell me how far it&rsquo;s gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t answer him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better make a clean breast of it.&nbsp; How
long has it been going on?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with
you, eh?&nbsp; Better tell me straight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The implication affronted her modesty, for though she had
fearfully imagined physical passion and its admonitions had found
their way into her dreams, the least suggestion of crudity
shocked her.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s words made her want to
cover her face for shame.&nbsp; Her resolution wavered.&nbsp; In
a piercing moment of revelation she saw the scene in which she
was taking a part: the <a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>hard, tasteless room, with its steel
engravings of sporting pictures and its horsehair-covered
furniture, the coarse cutlery that she had been putting on the
table, the metallic ticking bronze clock on the mantelpiece, the
worn hearthrug, and, in front of her, the angry, flushed face of
her father, the face of a man inflamed by passion and the
prejudices of his class.&nbsp; And she saw herself, a
farmer&rsquo;s daughter in a print overall, discovered, shamed,
in a gross affair with a labouring man.&nbsp; How many times in
the history of the countryside had the same scene been
enacted?&nbsp; How many women of her kind had been pestered with
the same urgent questions?&nbsp; And still he pressed her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be mended.&nbsp; Better
tell me straight, my girl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All her suppressed idealism rose in revolt against him,
against her surroundings, against her whole manner of life.&nbsp;
She hated her father and utterly despised him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t have you talking to me like that,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a child, and you
shan&rsquo;t treat me like one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a woman.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m nearly thirty.&nbsp; Do you think a woman can go on
living this miserable, separated life and settle down into an old
maid like Aunt Isabel without feeling anything?&nbsp; No . . .
people like you don&rsquo;t think that a woman should have any
feelings.&nbsp; You think as long as you&rsquo;re well fed and
get your glass of whisky at night and all your books kept up to
date, you think that&rsquo;s enough life for a woman, you think
that it&rsquo;s a privilege for her to spend her days looking
after you.&nbsp; Do you think a woman never wants a
man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prosser gasped.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;ve taken leave
of your senses, Marion,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a life to live as well as you!&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You call yourself a farmer, but you&rsquo;ve
no more idea of nature . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; She could say no more,
but threw her hands wide in a gesture of despair.</p>
<p>It slowly dawned on him that she was defending herself.&nbsp;
He saw himself shamed among his fellows.&nbsp; There had never
been a scandal at The Dyke in his time.&nbsp; He said:
&lsquo;Good God!&nbsp; Good God!&rsquo; then helped himself to
another glass of whisky and took a stiff gulp.&nbsp; <a
name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>&lsquo;Well, I never thought it of you,&rsquo; was all
he could say.&nbsp; He poured out another tot.</p>
<p>A sudden gust of anger swept over Marion.&nbsp; Scarcely
knowing what she did, she picked up the cut-glass whisky decanter
and sent it crashing into the fire.&nbsp; The flames roared up
the chimney; blue tongues of lighted spirit ran out over the
hearthrug.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marion!&nbsp; My God, you&rsquo;re mad!&rsquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll set the house afire!&nbsp; What
do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He snatched a rug from the sofa and went down on his knees
stifling the flame.&nbsp; She burst out into a fit of
uncontrollable laughter.&nbsp; He stared at her,
frightened.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you laughing at?&rsquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; she said weakly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I felt I must break something.&nbsp; What an awful
mess!&rsquo;&nbsp; The outburst had sobered her, and more than
that the sight of her father&rsquo;s scared and innocent
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right now,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch a cloth from the kitchen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked so bewildered that she couldn&rsquo;t help laughing
at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I can make you out,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve not the
least idea. . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s all right?&rsquo; he said solemnly.</p>
<p>The dawning relief in his face was too much for her.&nbsp; She
knelt down on the carpet beside him and kissed his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dad, you&rsquo;re too killing!&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think I can&rsquo;t look after
myself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, thank Heaven for that!&rsquo; was all he could
say.</p>
<p>They talked the matter out more soberly that evening over the
embers of the fire when Ethel had been sent off to bed.&nbsp;
They were as happy in each other&rsquo;s company and as tender as
lovers who have quarrelled and made it up again.&nbsp; The moment
of vision had faded for ever.&nbsp; The room in which they sat
had regained its old familiarity in Marion&rsquo;s eyes, forcing
itself to be accepted as her home; Mr Prosser was no longer a
coarse, fair-whiskered man with more than a drop of whisky in
him, but the father whom she had always known; the sombre life of
The Dyke, with its slow, <a name="page341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>rich comfort, was the life to which
she had been born.&nbsp; And she considered what would be the
effect on that life of her marrying Abner Fellows, for if her
father&rsquo;s suspicions had been justified there was no doubt
but that he would have compelled the lover to make an honest
woman of her.&nbsp; No happiness worth the daring lay in that
direction.&nbsp; She knew that she could hope for nothing but a
continual clashing of the two men&rsquo;s wills and herself a
buffer between them.&nbsp; Her father had a long memory for his
hates.&nbsp; There could never be any peace in the house till he
died.&nbsp; Rather than submit to such a humiliation she would
cut herself free from The Dyke and share Abner&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; Love in a cottage with a vengeance!&nbsp; But did he
love her?&nbsp; She had no real reason to believe it.&nbsp; And
did she love him?&nbsp; She could not say.&nbsp; Better, far
better, cling to the certainties, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll say no more about it,&rsquo; said Mr
Prosser.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let bygones be bygones, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head slowly at the fire.&nbsp; A piece of the
shattered decanter that had escaped her brush suddenly caught a
gleam of light.&nbsp; It meant no more to her now than a flake of
the stone-men&rsquo;s flint of the kind that she and Ethel found
on their picnics at Castel Ditches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course Fellows must go,&rsquo; said Mr
Prosser.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon I can find another man by the end
of the week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Marion murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;At the end of
the week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Luckily there&rsquo;s no scarcity of labour,&rsquo;
said Mr Prosser happily.</p>
<p>Marion&rsquo;s thoughts turned idly to Wolfpits.&nbsp; She
shut the idea of Wolfpits out of her mind.&nbsp; It was wrong,
she thought, that Mary Malpas should ever have come again into
her life.&nbsp; It was always wrong to uncover the past.&nbsp;
They sat for a long time in silence.&nbsp; She crouched on the
floor at her father&rsquo;s side and his arm was thrown
carelessly over her shoulder.&nbsp; His head nodded and he fell
asleep, but Marion still stared into the embers, seeing
nothing.&nbsp; It was nearly midnight when Mr Prosser woke with a
start and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I must have dropped off,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, look at the clock!&rsquo;&nbsp; He kissed her
good-night.</p>
<p><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>&lsquo;By the way,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I saw young
Fred Maddy over at Craven Arms.&nbsp; He talked about riding over
for tea Sunday.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s doing pretty well, is Fred
Maddy, since his father died.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stood blinking at her curiously; but she made him no
reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you put out the light in the kitchen, dad, and see
to the doors?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Next morning, when he had listened to Abner&rsquo;s own
version of Daisy&rsquo;s death and stood for a few moments in
contemplation of the carcass, Mr Prosser told him without
offering any explanation that he would not be wanted at The Dyke
after the end of the week.&nbsp; Abner took it for granted that
the loss of the cow explained his dismissal.&nbsp; It was a piece
of bad luck, and no more was to be said for it.&nbsp; The blow
was a heavy one, for he had felt that his position on the farm
was secure and that the fortunes of Wolfpits were safe for the
winter.&nbsp; He would have to begin his search for work all over
again, and this at a time when the demand for labour was at its
lowest.&nbsp; What made him particularly savage was the look of
triumph that he now saw on Harris&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; No doubt
the ploughman had managed to put a word in against him with Mr
Prosser.&nbsp; Well, a man who had taken such a hammering as
Harris got on the night of the harvest home had a right to get
his own back, particularly when fortune had given his enemy a
trip.</p>
<p>What puzzled Abner more was the strangeness of Marion&rsquo;s
attitude.&nbsp; He did not attach any great importance to her
breakdown in the farm kitchen and the tender moment that
followed: that was the kind of thing that might happen with any
woman: but he did find it rather shabby of her to abandon him as
soon as he was down on his luck, for he had always felt that she
was his friend and supporter, and knew, indeed, that he had owed
his job to her from the beginning.&nbsp; Still, he believed that
it was in keeping with human&mdash;and even more with feminine
nature&mdash;to kick a man when he was down.&nbsp; The school in
which he had been brought up had left him with few romantic
illusions: so, instead of brooding over her defection, he went on
steadily with his work until the day of his departure.</p>
<p><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>On
the last evening they met, for one moment only.&nbsp; She came
into the byre at milking-time and took up her old station in the
doorway, watching him as he worked.&nbsp; He looked round and
found her standing there: it was too dark for him to see her
face.&nbsp; She handed him the pails in silence, and when he had
finished and stood wiping his hands on his trousers, she said,
almost timidly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the last time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m sorry to
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry too,&rsquo; she said, though she could
not be sure that she was speaking the truth.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been a great help to us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He gave an uneasy laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;If that old Daisy
hadn&rsquo;t gone and catched cold,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; she asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a hard one to answer,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could help you.&rsquo;&nbsp; She found it
difficult to speak without wounding his delicacy.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you&rsquo;re in want of money at any time . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; She
felt it was her duty to give him anything she possessed.&nbsp; It
was necessary for her own self-esteem that she should not feel
under any obligation to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Money&rsquo;s no use to me,&rsquo; he said, falling
back on one of Mick Connor&rsquo;s characteristic phrases.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if ever you&rsquo;re in need?&rsquo; she
persisted.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know that Mrs Malpas and her children
are dependent on you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the second time that she had ever mentioned
Mary&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; She compelled herself to do so now
because in this way she could make it quite clear that the
incident of the other night was forgotten and that he could not
build on it.&nbsp; She wanted to clear herself at any
price.&nbsp; Even as she spoke the consciousness of her own
motives filled her with shame.&nbsp; She held out her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t forget that, will you?&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Miss Marion, you&rsquo;ve been a good friend to
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he took her hand in his.</p>
<p>His unexpected use of the respectful prefix emboldened her and
made her feel surer of herself.&nbsp; In a moment the
indefiniteness of the situation had gone.&nbsp; They were back on
their old footing of servant and mistress.&nbsp; Her <a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>heart gave
a leap of thankfulness.&nbsp; She felt that she was saved.&nbsp;
The man whose rough hand her fingers now touched for a moment was
no longer the symbol of an ideal but simply a farm-labourer whom
her father had dismissed.&nbsp; She withdrew her own hand
hurriedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll say good-bye, then,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, miss, and thank &rsquo;ee,&rsquo; said Abner,
and touched his cap.</p>
<p>The idea of leaving The Dyke had shocked him; but when he
passed down the drive for the last time, with Prosser&rsquo;s
money in his pocket, Abner experienced a sudden feeling of
relief.&nbsp; It was probable that hard times were ahead of him,
and yet he had never felt so free since the day when he left his
father&rsquo;s house at Halesby.&nbsp; When he got home he told
Mary with an affectation of lightness that he had got the
sack.&nbsp; Her first impulse was one of fear for their finances,
but almost as quickly she found herself thankful that Abner was
no longer in touch with Marion Prosser.&nbsp; The world in which
she and Marion had been friends was so far behind and spoke to
her so poignantly of a lost content that she was glad to be
wholly freed from it.&nbsp; She could not disguise the fact that
she was jealous of Marion, not only for this but for other
reasons.&nbsp; She put on a bold and heartening front.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a nice bit of money in hand,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;That shows how wise we were to go
easy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her show of cheerfulness and courage pleased him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I thought it &lsquo;d put you out a bit,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We ought to be used to uncertainty by this time,&rsquo;
she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you won&rsquo;t have
that long walk there and back.&nbsp; It was enough to take the
strength out of any man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a rum thing,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I
don&rsquo;t mind it any more than you do, leaving The
Dyke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must get a job nearer home now,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite a stranger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, I&rsquo;ll have a look round to-morrow,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>When the day came he had not the heart to set out in quest of
work.&nbsp; Instead of doing so he lounged all morning, and after
dinner took the children out for a long walk over the stark,
wintry fields.&nbsp; They were <a name="page345"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 345</span>wildly excited to go with him, for
it was now many months since they had known such a holiday.&nbsp;
Mary watched them, smiling as they left Wolfpits.&nbsp; She saw
that they were happy, and marvelled at her own happiness.&nbsp;
Abner and the children made their way through the silent
larchwoods to the top of Castel Ditches and sat there gazing idly
down upon the river valleys.&nbsp; About the time when cohorts of
starlings wheeled through the sky above the reed-beds of the
Barbel where they made their nightly roosting place, the three of
them dropped down the slope towards the waterworks.&nbsp; There
Abner found a diminished gang still working on the last details
of the track.&nbsp; The sidings, the cranes, and the engines were
gone, and in place of the trenches on which Abner had worked a
year before, he now saw trim walls, culverts, and bridges of
stone.&nbsp; A single wooden hut remained standing, and there he
found the Gunner rubbing his hands over a bucket of coke.&nbsp;
He stared at Abner as though he were a stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, our Abner,&rsquo; he cried, when he recognised
him, &lsquo;how goes it?&nbsp; I thought you&rsquo;d left these
parts long ago.&nbsp; What have you been up to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Farm-labouring, up at The Dyke,&rsquo; Abner told
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a poor game,&rsquo; said the Gunner,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it!&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just finished with it. . .&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
you give us a job here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my son . . . nor any one else,&rsquo; said the
Gunner.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;re just clearing up like.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got ten men of the old gang left, but in another week
we shall have finished the lot.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you imagine
I&rsquo;m sorry for it either.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had enough of
Mainstone to last me for a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got to get a job somehow,&rsquo; said
Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you won&rsquo;t get it here.&nbsp; This place is
dead, my son, and that&rsquo;s the truth!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d best
get back to dear old Brum.&nbsp; Or Coventry, that&rsquo;s the
place for you.&nbsp; Everybody&rsquo;s going mad on these here
motor-cars the same as they did on bicycles.&nbsp;
Coventry&rsquo;s your ticket!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He gave the children a red-cheeked apple apiece.&nbsp; Abner
bade him good-night and turned homewards.</p>
<p><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>&lsquo;Did you hear about our wedding at the Pound
House?&rsquo; the foreman shouted after him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Whisky?&nbsp; You could have swum in it!&nbsp; Pity old
Mick wasn&rsquo;t about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was dusk when Abner reached Wolfpits.</p>
<p>He began his quest for a new job hopefully, undeterred by the
foreman&rsquo;s warning or the still gloomier prophecies of old
man Drew.&nbsp; He knew that work was scarce at that season; but
it could not well be scarcer than it had been when he found
continued employment at The Dyke.&nbsp; Abner felt that luck
would come to him in much the same unexpected way.</p>
<p>His first attempts seemed full of promise.&nbsp; At the time
when he had set out canvassing before, he had always been
received with a kind of negative pessimism that he learned to
consider as the normal attitude toward life of the border
farmer.&nbsp; Now, he noticed that the farm-people, and
particularly the women, listened to his applications with more
interest, remembered his name, asked him questions about himself,
and even appeared to regard his person with curiosity.&nbsp; He
took this as a good sign; but though he was encouraged his hopes
came no nearer to realisation.&nbsp; One after another the local
farmers or their wives heard his story, had a good look at him,
and turned him down.</p>
<p>The reason for their interest was not far to seek.&nbsp; In
spite of Mr Prosser&rsquo;s anxiety to keep dark the true cause
of Abner&rsquo;s dismissal and the scandal that it implied,
Harris, the ploughman, had not been able to resist the temptation
of making public his enemy&rsquo;s discomfiture, and though
nobody dared to whisper to the principal actors in the comedy
that they knew what had happened, the whole story of Marion
Prosser&rsquo;s infatuation for her father&rsquo;s cowman went
the rounds of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; At Ludlow market it passed
for a good tale against Prosser, who was envied for his
possessions, and Marion, whose aloofness had made her
unpopular.</p>
<p>In the most frequent version of the story Abner had been
caught out with Marion in the byre at a time when that astute
young woman had arranged for her father to stay the night at
Craven Arms for his health&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Marion, it was
said, had refused, for the most pressing of reasons, to give her
cowman up; but <a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>Prosser&rsquo;s family pride&mdash;a well-known
quantity&mdash;had been so deeply wounded that he had threatened
to shoot the fellow on the spot and let his daughter&rsquo;s name
go hang.&nbsp; The men enjoyed the joke against Prosser; the
women were agreed that proud creatures such as Marion usually
found their own level by some such violent means.&nbsp; The
principal question of interest that remained was where Marion
would go to hide her shameful condition.</p>
<p>In every stratum of local society from that of Lesswardine
Court to that of the newly-married Mrs Badger at the Pentre, the
incident was discussed; but nobody in the district heard it with
more triumph and satisfaction than old Mrs Malpas of the
Buffalo.&nbsp; By this time the whole village was so used to her
vilifications of Mary that they were scarcely taken seriously,
for village opinion, even when it is censorious in expression,
is, as a rule, charitable in deed.&nbsp; Now that she found
herself armed with a new enormity to reinforce the old, she set
herself steadily to the task of making it impossible for Abner to
find work.&nbsp; She determined to drive him out of the district,
for in this way she knew that Mary and her children must undergo
the suffering that they deserved and that Abner&rsquo;s devotion
had spared them.</p>
<p>With incredible patience she made it her business to interview
every farmer within five miles of Lesswardine and to beg him, or
failing him his wife, to refuse employment to such a scandalous
character.&nbsp; The Wesleyan minister at Chapel Green, who
regarded Mrs Malpas as one of the principal pillars of his
church, helped her in this, and only the laziness of the vicar of
Mainstone prevented his wife from making him a party to the same
plan.&nbsp; Abner, in his ignorance, was faced by a deliberate
boycott.&nbsp; The men who spoke him fairly, when he asked them
for work were prepared to see him and the family that he
supported starve before they gave it to him.</p>
<p>For a whole month this heart-breaking business went on.&nbsp;
When first Abner began to look for work Mary had greeted him
every evening with enquiring eyes, Now she no longer dared ask
him what had happened during the day.&nbsp; The monotony of
unfulfilled promises <a name="page348"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 348</span>told on him.&nbsp; He began to avoid
her society and to shrink from that of the children, trying to
exhaust his strength with long walks afield and cutting wood for
Mrs Mamble and old Drew as well as for their own household.&nbsp;
She pitied him with all her heart, but dared not show him pity
lest it should tax his courage too heavily.&nbsp; Money was
running short.&nbsp; She starved herself in order that he and the
children might not lack, and thus found herself dragged into a
vicious circle, for her sacrifice lessened her own resistance and
made her temper uneven and liable to be irritated by
Abner&rsquo;s moroseness.&nbsp; They did not speak of their
troubles, but neither of them could see what the end would
be.</p>
<p>Wolfpits, in its utter isolation, was the last place in the
district that rumour ever reached.&nbsp; It was five weeks after
Abner had left The Dyke when Mrs Mamble heard the cause of
Abner&rsquo;s dismissal and whispered it to Mary.&nbsp; In a
normal state she might have borne it, but her exhaustion made her
an easy prey to jealousy.&nbsp; One evening Abner found her
unusually pale and speechless, and asked her what was the matter
with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only just heard the truth,&rsquo; she said,
scarcely controlling her passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about?&rsquo; he asked innocently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About why you left The Dyke.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you
tell me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did tell you.&nbsp; You know as well as I
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never said a word about Marion.&nbsp; Not one
word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s been putting that rubbidge into your
head?&rsquo; said Abner angrily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rubbish!&rsquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can call
it that now!&nbsp; But if you&rsquo;d left the girl alone we
shouldn&rsquo;t be where we are now, not knowing where to look
for a shilling and the children likely to want for
bread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got a maggot in your head, missus,&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why I left The Dyke&rsquo;s got nothing to
do with Miss Marion, so don&rsquo;t you think it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m tired of you!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use your telling off your lies to me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m dead sick of you and your women . . . you and your
Susie Hinds and Marion <a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>Prossers!&nbsp; Running after loose
women with your eyes shut and never a thought for those that keep
themselves decent like me.&nbsp; And if there was another caught
your eye to-morrow, you&rsquo;d be up and away after her the
same.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re no better than an animal!&nbsp; Like the
rest of men: they&rsquo;re all the same!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stood up to him, trembling with rage.&nbsp; At that moment
she was ugly, and rising to the violence of her challenge, he
hated her.&nbsp; He lost sight of her weakness.&nbsp; All he saw
was her impudent provocation.&nbsp; An answering anger fumed up
into his head and carried him away so that he could easily have
struck her.&nbsp; He came towards her with his hand lifted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she shrieked in
terror.</p>
<p>He dropped his hand and walked straight out of the room.&nbsp;
Left alone, she was overborne with shame for what she had done,
and cried for her lost dignity.&nbsp; Never in her life had she
so abased herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;But he lied to me!&nbsp; He lied
to me!&rsquo; she told herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t
lied to me it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened!&rsquo;&nbsp; Little
by little the turmoil of her thoughts abated and she began to
remember his goodness, his patience, all that she owed to
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;If he had struck me,&rsquo; she thought,
&lsquo;I should have deserved it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She almost wished
that his hand had fallen, for nothing less than a blow could have
justified her violence and her base ingratitude.&nbsp; The only
thing with which she could comfort herself was a firm
determination that she would never offend him again.&nbsp; By
nothing but the most complete sacrifice of her feelings could she
repay him a thousandth part of what she owed him.</p>
<p>After that day she never uttered one complaint, though the
tale of her sufferings increased beyond the bounds of
endurance.&nbsp; To their hardships she turned a front of steel,
but to Abner himself she was as tender as she dared to be.&nbsp;
The consciousness of this discipline sustained her.&nbsp; She was
a new woman, worn and anxious but invincibly cheerful; and Abner
himself took heart from her courage.</p>
<p>Winter fell upon them.&nbsp; The snow-bound ramparts of the
hills came nearer to them, encircling the valley with a clear-cut
beauty.&nbsp; The colours of life faded <a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>from the
land, and every farm was like a fortress of stone, close-barred
against the assaults of rain and icy wind.&nbsp; The fields lay
cold and dead; the sap sank downward from every frozen
branch.&nbsp; There was no colour in all the land but a brilliant
mockery of red berries on brier and holly and thorn.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a tarrable lot of berry this year,&rsquo;
said old Drew.&nbsp; &lsquo;I reckon we&rsquo;m in for a hard
winter again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so the remotest possibility of finding work on the farms
drifted away from Abner.&nbsp; The few labourers who moved about
the fields, the solitary teams at plough, seemed glued to the
frozen surface of the land, stirring sadly as in a dream.&nbsp;
In spite of the kindness of their neighbours, so delicately shown
in the gifts of roots and bundles of wood that old Drew carried
home on his bent shoulders, the family at Wolfpits felt the pinch
of cold and want.&nbsp; Mary, true to her resolution, uttered no
word of complaint, but her face told Abner what she was suffering
so plainly that he could not bear to look at her.&nbsp; One night
he left her and spent the evening with old Drew in his bedroom,
drinking the labourer&rsquo;s home-made poison till his brain was
fuddled and his limbs, for the first time, were warm.&nbsp; Mary
heard him stumbling up the stairs at night, but when they met
next morning she did not reproach him.</p>
<p>Her little store of money was nearly gone.&nbsp; One day,
racking her brains for some new expedient to stave off the
inevitable end, she remembered Mrs Malpas&rsquo;s visit and the
story of the fifty pounds which George had stolen from the
Buffalo on the eve of his imprisonment.&nbsp; She wondered,
desperately, if the old woman was right, and he had hidden it in
some corner of the house.&nbsp; She began to search, with the
fierce enthusiasm of a seeker after treasure.&nbsp; She spent all
her energy in turning the bedroom and kitchen inside out; she
looked into the chimneys, for she had heard that money was
sometimes hidden in such places.&nbsp; By the end of the day she
was utterly exhausted but had found nothing.&nbsp; &lsquo;At any
rate,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;the place looks
tidier.&rsquo;&nbsp; A poor consolation!</p>
<p>That night it occurred to her that if only she could get as
far as Shrewsbury she might pawn some of her <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>wedding
presents, particularly a set of plated tea-things which her
father, lavish in the expenditure of other people&rsquo;s money,
had given her.&nbsp; They made a clumsy parcel, difficult to
conceal, and in order to spend as little as possible on the
railway fare she decided to walk over the hills towards Clun and
catch a train on the branch railway.&nbsp; She left the children
in Mrs Mamble&rsquo;s care, and slipped away without letting
Abner know that she had gone.&nbsp; In Shrewsbury a sad
discouragement awaited her.&nbsp; The man in the pawnshop sniffed
at her property.&nbsp; &lsquo;This kind of thing&rsquo;s gone out
of fashion,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you&rsquo;d brought
it here five year ago I might have done better for you.&nbsp;
Twenty-five shillings&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s worth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The sacrifice hurt her, but she accepted his figure.&nbsp; The
fare home to Llandwlas left her with a guinea in hand, and on
that money they existed for more than two weeks.&nbsp; She only
prayed that Abner would not notice the blank in the cupboard from
which she had taken the silver, but she need not have been
frightened, for Abner had no eye for things of that kind.&nbsp;
One imprudence, however, nearly betrayed her.&nbsp; On the way to
the station at Shrewsbury she had seen a box of oranges newly
imported for Christmas and had not been able to resist the
temptation of buying two for the children.&nbsp; Next day Abner
saw them on the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oranges?&rsquo; he said, his eyes shocked by her
extravagance.</p>
<p>She lied quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mrs Hendrie met me on the road and gave me them
for Morgan and Gladys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Afterward, in the curiously sensitive state of her conscience,
this lie troubled her.&nbsp; He himself was so open with her that
she felt it almost a duty to tell him the truth.&nbsp; She
brooded over the question for several days, but in the end it
sank into insignificance before the fact that they had no money
left.&nbsp; Looking at her empty purse she felt that she could
face the situation no longer.&nbsp; She dared not ask for credit
in any shop in Mainstone, for she suspected that all the
shop-people must be aware of her plight.&nbsp; Greatly daring,
she made an expedition to Lesswardine and entered a
grocer&rsquo;s <a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>with whom she had not dealt since the days before her
marriage.&nbsp; The man had been a friend of her
father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Perhaps that would count for something.</p>
<p>It was Saturday night, and the shop was buzzing with
people.&nbsp; The grocer, flurried with work, scarcely nodded to
her, and she was nearly leaving the shop in fright when a new
assistant whom she did not know asked her what he could serve her
with.&nbsp; Fortunately, she had dressed herself with care and
looked respectable.&nbsp; She ordered blindly, lavishly, and the
smart young man dumped her purchases on the counter with a
flourish and dashed off the bill with a pencil that he carried
behind his ear in a hieroglyphic of his own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cash or account, madam?&rsquo; he asked rapidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Account,&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; What was the name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs Malpas, Wolfpits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said the young man, excusing
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pardon.&nbsp; Shall we send
them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s Sunday, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;d better take them with
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, madam.&nbsp; Very kind of you,&rsquo; said
the assistant, making a large blue-paper parcel, which he handed
her over the counter with an obsequious bow.</p>
<p>She picked up her parcel and fled, thankful that the grocer
was too busy to notice her.&nbsp; She felt that the eyes of all
the women were on her and that they knew her for a thief.&nbsp;
Also she knew that she could never attempt this adventure
again.</p>
<p>So the end came, or what they thought must be the end.&nbsp;
They sat together one night in the kitchen at Wolfpits, and both
of them knew that they were beaten.&nbsp; A fire burned brightly
in the hearth&mdash;in this thickly wooded valley they need never
lack warmth&mdash;the room seemed cosy and almost gay in the
firelight, showing no signs that they had fallen from prosperity,
for though Mary had paid three more visits to the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s and now felt hardened to the adventure, she
had always managed to conceal the deficiencies in the furniture
by some new arrangement.&nbsp; On her last journey to Shrewsbury,
hurrying to the station under the walls of the jail, the idea had
struck her that she might be forced <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>in the end to pawn her wedding ring,
and she had laughed bitterly to herself.&nbsp; Much good had it
done her!&nbsp; The idea had only struck her as a whimsical
prospect.&nbsp; She had too much common sense to allow herself to
be driven to this conventional expedient.&nbsp; She knew that
they could not go on indefinitely stripping the house of its
furniture.&nbsp; It would be far better to face the facts.&nbsp;
If Abner could not find work, and there seemed no probability of
his doing so, the best that they could do was to part.&nbsp; He
must leave her, and she, pocketing her pride, must apply to the
relieving officer, whom she had once shown to the door, for money
from the parish.&nbsp; She knew that it must come to this, and
yet she could not bring herself to tell Abner.&nbsp; She had
settled in her mind that the proposal must come from him, and for
the present he seemed numbed, worn, incapable of thinking.&nbsp;
He sat opposite her in silence with an empty pipe between his
teeth staring at the fire.&nbsp; After a little while she found
herself silently weeping, and turned her face away from him,
blowing her nose to hide her tears.</p>
<p>Some one knocked at the door, and she cried: &lsquo;Come
in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was old Drew.&nbsp; They were not surprised.&nbsp; By this
time they were used to the labourer&rsquo;s visits.&nbsp; Often,
in the evening, he would drop in with the excuse of having a talk
with Abner, though most of the talking fell to Mary, and then,
just as he was on the point of leaving, he would produce from one
of the vast pockets in his coat some article of food that he had
picked up at the farm.&nbsp; They knew so well this delicate
subterfuge!&nbsp; At first Mary had been amused by it, and more
than a little touched.&nbsp; Now she only waited impatiently to
see what the old man had brought.</p>
<p>That night it seemed as if he would never go; but just when
they had reached the point when it seemed that the eggs or
turnips must appear, he turned to Abner and told him that he had
some good news for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good news?&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a
long time since I&rsquo;ve heard anything of that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was talking about &rsquo;ee to Mr Willums,&rsquo;
said Drew, <a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>&lsquo;and told en that you was in a purty bad
way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Drew,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if
it&rsquo;s as bad as that, I don&rsquo;t say we mightn&rsquo;t do
something.&nbsp; There do be a heap of stones scattered over the
top fields as us might well be rid on.&nbsp; It do be a
boy&rsquo;s work, &rsquo;tis true, but Fellows might be glad of
it.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary flushed with pleasure and clasped her hands.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;d be glad of anything,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; the old man went on, &lsquo;I do reckon
that there be no more&rsquo;n a fortnight&rsquo;s work there, and
a poor, niggling job that&rsquo;s like to break your back at
that.&nbsp; But I thought you&rsquo;d be glad of it, and I told
en so.&nbsp; So up you comes along with me at six o&rsquo;clock
to-morrow morning, for I told en you&rsquo;d come for sure.&nbsp;
Threepence an hour he&rsquo;ll pay &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; That makes
twelve shillin&rsquo; a week.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not much, but
&rsquo;tis something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They thanked him without reserve, but he shook his head at
them.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know as it&rsquo;s me you have
to thank,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis your old mother down
to the Buffalo as you&rsquo;d ought to be grateful to.&nbsp; Mr
Willums have took it into his head as giving Abner work would
make her mazed.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve never forgive her over that
cider, and never will.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a long memory, Mr
Willums.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he left them Mary was so full of an emotional
thankfulness that she could not speak.&nbsp; Abner went to bed
cheerfully.&nbsp; She heard him whistling in his room above
her.</p>
<p>Next morning his work at the Pentre began.&nbsp; As Mr
Williams had said, it was a boy&rsquo;s work by rights and
unfitted to a man of Abner&rsquo;s strength.&nbsp; At first sight
it seemed like one of those labours which malignant kings impose
upon their daughters&rsquo; suitors in fairy tales.&nbsp; The
Pentre was a large farm of miserable land.&nbsp; Its uppermost
cultivated fields reached nearly to the crown of the smooth hills
at the valley head, ending abruptly at the foot of stony
screes.&nbsp; From these unstable precipices the winter torrents
rolled down many stones, flat rocky fragments that impeded the
plough.&nbsp; Nor were these all, for the soil was so thin, that
every ploughing turned up thousands more, and in winter the
fields were overspread with a pale bloom of stones.</p>
<p>At this season of the year the uplands were always <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>cold,
enwrapped in icy vapours or glistening with frost that glued each
fragment to the ground.&nbsp; Abner&rsquo;s task was to clear
these stubborn acres of their surface stones: an endless labour,
for no sooner had he picked the surface over than new stones
appeared.&nbsp; No convict labour could have been more
monotonous, more thankless, nor, as it seemed, more futile.&nbsp;
From dawn to sunset he worked in loneliness.&nbsp; No single
human figure approached him all day long except that of Mr
Williams, whom he would see coming like a speck in the lower
distance urging his pony upwards.&nbsp; When he reached Abner the
farmer would stay scowling at him for a few minutes.&nbsp; He was
a surly man, and rarely spoke except on Monday evenings after
Ludlow market.&nbsp; Then, having satisfied himself that Abner
was not shirking, he would turn away and walk his pony down the
hill again.</p>
<p>There was never any fear that Abner would not work.&nbsp; It
was only by violent exertion that he could keep any heat in his
body, for his food was poor, and the winter, as old Drew had
prophesied, severe.&nbsp; He toiled there in rain, in sleet, in
snow, and in blinding mist.&nbsp; The pay was so poor that he
knew he could not afford to miss a day, picking up stones with
numbed and ragged fingers when no other labourers were
afield.&nbsp; Every evening he walked home dead tired, scarcely
knowing if his legs were his own, for the continual stooping took
all sensation away from them.</p>
<p>Once, in the dusk, he lost his way, for he had tried to
shorten his journey by a cross-cut.&nbsp; He found himself
suddenly on the brink of the sea-crows&rsquo; pool, but not a
bird was to be seen, for in winter they returned to their homes
on the Cardigan coast.&nbsp; His memory of what had happened
there was as hazy as that of a dream.&nbsp; It seemed to him that
he had lived half a lifetime since that night.&nbsp; He stumbled
down through the fog and passed the door of Badger&rsquo;s
cottage.&nbsp; A light burned in the window, and he thought he
saw Susie moving in the parlour.&nbsp; He laughed to himself and
damned her . . . damned all women.&nbsp; Another evening on his
way home a dog-cart overtook him coming over the hills from
Clun.&nbsp; It had passed him before he saw <a
name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>that its
occupants were Marion Prosser and a young farmer named Maddy,
whom Abner only knew by sight.&nbsp; They bowled by him at a good
pace.&nbsp; He wondered if she had recognised him, for he had
been in their sight for some time.&nbsp; If she had, she made no
sign of having seen him.&nbsp; And again he hardened his heart
against all women.</p>
<p>And yet, though he did not know it, the sight of Abner
trudging homeward down the lane had awakened a palpitating
interest in Marion&rsquo;s heart, and inspired her with a sudden
distaste for the man who was sitting in the trap beside
her.&nbsp; She looked down on him from the height of the
driver&rsquo;s seat, seeing his mean shoulders, the thin nape of
his neck, and his small foxy face in profile.&nbsp; She felt that
she would like to lash at him with the whip that she held in her
hand; but since she knew that ladylike young women did not do
such things, she flicked him with the lash of her tongue
instead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was Fellows, our cowman, Fred,&rsquo; she said,
knowing that the name would wound him.</p>
<p>He gave an ugly laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know him.&nbsp; He had
the face to come and ask me for work.&nbsp; I soon gave him the
right-about!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo; she cried scornfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not fit to talk to him!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
twice the man that you are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He flushed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look here, Marion, who the hell do
you think you&rsquo;re talking to?&rsquo; he said, clutching her
arm with a show of strength.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; She wrenched
herself free and slapped his face.&nbsp; The horse broke into a
canter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not the way to get yourself
married,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She would not reply to his insult and they drove to The Dyke
in an uncomfortable silence.</p>
<p>Next day she set out deliberately to meet Abner on the
road.&nbsp; She called &lsquo;Good-evening&rsquo; to him, but he,
still smarting under the discomfort of Mary&rsquo;s outburst,
would not answer her.&nbsp; She followed him and took him by the
arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you ever
forgive me?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like to think of the way we
parted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t bear you any ill-will,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all over and done
with.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>&lsquo;I want you to think of me as a friend,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Abner, if ever you&rsquo;re in need of
money . . . if you want money now . . . I wish you&rsquo;d take
it from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in work now,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d best leave us alone.&nbsp; We
don&rsquo;t want your money.&rsquo;&nbsp; His resentment burst
out afresh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nor you neither,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>She controlled herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s understood,&rsquo; she said, and left him without
another word.</p>
<p>She walked home violently in the dusk, thinking of the
desperate mess she had made of her life, wondering if she could
ever bring herself to marry a man with sloping shoulders and a
squeaky voice like Fred Maddy.&nbsp; What did it matter?&nbsp;
What did anything matter?</p>
<p>Mr Williams had reckoned that the top fields would provide
Abner with a fortnight&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; He had merely given
him the job to satisfy a passing whim of inflicting a pin-prick
on Mrs Malpas, and had told him from the first that he could not
continue to employ him when the work was done.&nbsp; Luckily for
Abner at the end of the fortnight half the fields remained
uncleared.&nbsp; Mr Williams recognised that he had worked well,
and decided to keep him on, for perhaps another ten days.&nbsp;
The expense was trivial, and the job worth doing.&nbsp;
Christmas, his second Christmas at Wolfpits, intervened, but by
the third of January Abner&rsquo;s work at the Pentre was nearly
finished.</p>
<h2><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>The
Twenty-Third Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> again the situation had to be
faced.&nbsp; This time Abner was in no doubt as to what must be
done.&nbsp; Those lonely days on the cold upland had given him
time to think.&nbsp; He now realised that as far as finding work
in the Lesswardine district went he was definitely beaten, and
that every day that he spent at Wolfpits must make him more and
more a drag upon the resources of the family.&nbsp; The obvious
thing for him to do was to turn his early experiences at Mawne to
account, to set off southward for the coal valleys and work as a
miner underground.&nbsp; On the Welsh coalfield, wages ran high
and he might be sure of earning enough to keep himself in comfort
and to supply the Wolfpits household with a living that would
seem luxurious after their long privations.&nbsp; In solitude
this determination had been easily made, and the feeling that
something definite was in view had made him happier and better
pleased with himself; but when he left the Pentre and came to lay
his plans before Mary, his course did not seem so clear or so
free from complications.</p>
<p>During their three months of hardship their relations had
undergone a curious change.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s outburst of
jealous anger when she learned the true cause of his dismissal
from The Dyke, had swept through her like a storm, stripping her
heart of its hidden grudges and reservations.&nbsp; It passed,
leaving her weak, bewildered, and yet happy.&nbsp; It was as if
this sudden tempest, while almost destroying her, had snapped the
last threads that bound her to her old life.&nbsp; All the past
was broken.&nbsp; It rolled away from her in a tumult of spent
cloud, and in the serene silence that followed she came to
herself, realising that she was alone in the world with Abner and
her children.&nbsp; It was like the bewildered calm that comes
after an escape from death; the hushed birth of a new world; a
strange, unearthly quiet.</p>
<p>In this new state she found herself most eager to atone <a
name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>for the
endless, wordless contest that she had waged against him.&nbsp;
She knew that she could never repay him a hundredth part of what
he had given her and suffered at her hands.&nbsp; The money was
nothing.&nbsp; What he had sacrificed for her was his freedom, a
hard denial for a man in the prime of youth.&nbsp; And so,
thinking gratefully of his goodness toward her and of his
unfathomed patience, she began to dwell tenderly on other aspects
of the man: his splendid, supple strength, his honest eyes, the
straightness and simplicity of his whole nature, and to compare
them, instinctively, with what she knew of her husband: his
superficial charm, his persuasive manners, and his callous heart:
all those qualities that she had been taught by bitterest
experience to hate and to mistrust.&nbsp; It was in this light
that Abner seemed to her most wonderful.&nbsp; And she had used
him like a shrew!&nbsp; Every natural impulse of kindness in him
she had checked and thwarted!&nbsp; Pride had made her thankless;
prudishness had hardened her.&nbsp; She was detestable, and if he
hated her she had only herself to thank for it.</p>
<p>But did he hate her?&nbsp; She hoped, fervently, that he did
not.&nbsp; She could not bear that he should hate her.&nbsp; It
pained her even to think that she owed his kindness to the fact
that he had given some promise to George, and in the simplicity
of his nature felt that he must redeem it.&nbsp; She knew that he
was fond of the children and could not bear to see them suffer;
but that was not enough for her.&nbsp; Her new being craved for a
personal devotion.&nbsp; If that were not forthcoming she felt
that she would have little left in the world, that her life must
be finally bitter and useless.&nbsp; And she knew that she was
far too young for any such finality.&nbsp; She hated the pride
that had brought her to this, and resolved to proclaim her new
humility by every means in her power.</p>
<p>Abner himself was sensible of the change in her attitude
toward him.&nbsp; During the time of his work at the Pentre, he
became aware of it.&nbsp; Little by little, for she was far too
cautious to make the change a sudden one, she was demolishing the
barrier that she had built so carefully between them, and he,
reluctantly, had <a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
360</span>accepted.&nbsp; Slowly, almost imperceptibly, they were
nearing once more the point which they had reached in a moment of
stress and abandonment on the night of the white mist six months
before, the moment when he had seen her transfigured, or rather
revealed, as the one woman in the world whom he wanted, body and
soul.</p>
<p>In all those hard days not a single chilling word passed her
lips, not a single intolerable silence drove him away from
her.&nbsp; Her kindness made her beautiful, but the nearness of
her beauty frightened him and he withdrew himself, having once
cruelly burnt his fingers at that flame.&nbsp; He was happy, but
could not trust his happiness, not because any scruples of honour
pricked him, but because he feared a new rebuff.</p>
<p>Even though he dared not believe in her submission he could
not escape the influence of her tenderness.&nbsp; The lean days
were the best he had ever known at Wolfpits: even if he had had
money to spend he would not have gone elsewhere, and every moment
that brought him nearer to the inevitable parting on which he had
decided, made the idea of it more painful and more
difficult.&nbsp; It now seemed to him monstrously unreasonable
that when such complete happiness was in his grasp he should
wilfully renounce it.&nbsp; And yet, what else could he do?&nbsp;
A sense of the futility of her kindness made him shrink from
it.</p>
<p>She saw what was happening, knew that she deserved it, and in
order that she might justify herself she now tried to play on his
affection for the children, to create an atmosphere of
interdependence among the four of them, to bind him closer to her
with a web of many strands each so slender that he need not be
aware of the process.&nbsp; But he felt the light pressure of the
net in which he was being entangled; he struggled to free
himself.&nbsp; And she saw the convulsions of his struggle and
feared to lose him.&nbsp; The thrill of this new, half-hidden
conflict held her.</p>
<p>On the Saturday night before his last week at the Pentre, he
kept back five shillings of his earnings.&nbsp; By working from
dawn till sunset each day he had managed to put in many hours of
overtime, so that he was able to give her half a sovereign
clear.&nbsp; It seemed to him a <a name="page361"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 361</span>good opportunity for breaking the
news of his plan to her.&nbsp; Sooner or later the word must be
spoken.&nbsp; She held the gold coin in her hand and looked at
him inquiringly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be two bob short this week,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;but if any one knows how to manage, you do.&nbsp;
After that I reckon things&rsquo;ll begin to look up a
bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She flushed with a sudden pleasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
mean to say that Mr Williams is going to keep you on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not he!&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
not more than four or five days left of the stone picking, and I
can tell you I&rsquo;m not all that sorry.&nbsp; My back&rsquo;s
fair broke at it!&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;m thinking of a change.&nbsp;
I might stay on round here a year before I find another job worth
calling one.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got a down on you and me, these
farming chaps, them and your old mother.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only
one thing to be done as I can see.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s what
I&rsquo;ve kept five bob back for to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, Abner,&rsquo; she said,
understanding only too well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll tell
you.&nbsp; While I&rsquo;ve been up on the hill I&rsquo;ve had a
good few hours for thinking.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve reckoned it all up
square.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s about four month as you&rsquo;ll have
to hang on here afore old George comes out, and you can&rsquo;t
keep the lot of us for four odd month on nothing.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s clear enough, bain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She assented.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I thought like this.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use of a
chap of my sort, that&rsquo;s learned a trade and all, and can
pick up good money at it, going round cadging work from a lot of
beggars that don&rsquo;t mean to give it me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had
a bellyful of farmers&rsquo; promises, I have, and I tell you
straight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again she said: &lsquo;Yes . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so this is how I see it.&nbsp; The only thing left
for me when I&rsquo;ve finished along with old Williams is to
take a turn down Swansea way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swansea?&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; I looked it up Sunday in the
time-table on Llandwlas station, and asked about the fare.&nbsp;
You <a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>go
down through Builth and Brecon and Neath, and five bob&rsquo;ll
do it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s plenty of work going in the Western
Valleys, they say, and good money and all.&nbsp; You can pick up
two pound ten a week, without killing yourself either.&nbsp; They
say lodging&rsquo;s dear, but I reckon I can send you a clear
pound easy: postal orders you can change at Mainstone and nobody
know where they come from.&nbsp; I ought to have done it
before.&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; But now it looks like as if
there&rsquo;s nothing else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While he spoke he was walking up and down the little room,
never looking at her.&nbsp; Her eyes followed him, but her heart
fell within her.&nbsp; He finished and faced her.&nbsp; She could
scarcely answer him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean that you must go away . . . leave
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
ought to have done it afore.&nbsp; If I had they&rsquo;d have
left you alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t live on nothing,&rsquo; he said
brutally.</p>
<p>She could not listen to reason.&nbsp; She was beyond reason
now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Abner, you
mustn&rsquo;t go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He set his will against her.&nbsp; She stood and trembled
before him, but he would not face her for fear that he should be
softened.&nbsp; He kept silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she cried again.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t face it . . . the loneliness!&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t, really!&nbsp; This place . . . all alone.&nbsp;
No, Abner, you can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not for so long,&rsquo; he reassured
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s four month?&nbsp; After that
you&rsquo;ll have George back again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;George!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t
speak of it!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re cruel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her words came as a shock to him.&nbsp; It was now many months
since they had spoken of George.&nbsp; Since the evening of his
letter she had not even mentioned his name to the children nor
encouraged Abner to talk about him.&nbsp; Abner saw the fateful
direction in which the tide was drifting, and held steadily to
his course.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not so long since,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;that you told me to go away if I wanted to.&nbsp; The time
they tried to get you to go and keep house for the parson.&nbsp;
I reckon you&rsquo;ve changed about a good bit since
then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve changed,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was a fool then.&nbsp; <a name="page363"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 363</span>I didn&rsquo;t know what I
wanted.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s different now.&rsquo;&nbsp; She paused,
and then returned instinctively to her first words.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re talking wild,&rsquo; he said
brusquely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve thought it all out.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the only thing.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have the comfort
you&rsquo;m used to, you and the kids.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t find
it all that lonely with your stomachs full.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
bad times we&rsquo;ve been having that makes you talk like
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still she protested.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, no, it
isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t bear it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
like taking the life away from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t wait to think what she meant.&nbsp; He was
angry that she should increase the difficulty of his parting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good talking to you,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;if you can&rsquo;t see sense.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t take you
along with me, can I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stood before him, meek, submissive.&nbsp; He was
overwhelmed.&nbsp; Through all those months he had schooled
himself so thoroughly that this sudden, voluntary surrender
staggered him.&nbsp; His heart melted within him; the blood beat
in his wrists.&nbsp; The past shrivelled away in that
moment&rsquo;s flame.&nbsp; The future was a blaze of light, and
in the present he saw nothing but the woman of his desire.&nbsp;
There had been no one like her.&nbsp; In all his lighter loves he
had been able to see himself from without as a creature fevered
with appetite.&nbsp; But now he was lost.&nbsp; He knew nothing
in the world but Mary: her softened eyes, the curve of her lips,
the thrill of her yielding body.&nbsp; He picked her up in his
arms, holding her so that her breath came quickly on his cheek,
and strained her toward him as though, by doing so, he might make
her a part of himself.&nbsp; Even if he killed her with his
strength in that moment she was made his, clasped immutably to
him in the surrounding darkness.&nbsp; Their lips were joined in
eager kisses.&nbsp; Her proud body gave itself to his arms.&nbsp;
Her eyes were closed: her lips infinitely happy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary, Mary . . .&rsquo; he whispered to her, rejoicing
in the sound of her name.&nbsp; But his voice was strange,
distant, thick with passion, and his clasping hands could not be
certain that they held her.&nbsp; They followed every <a
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>curve of
her body, seeking to know if it were really she.&nbsp; His tongue
stumbled on phrases that had never come to him before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary, my little one, my beauty!&nbsp; Did I use you
rough?&nbsp; Did I hurt you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head and smiled back at him, full of
content.&nbsp; She herself, shyly daring, allowed her hands to
caress his head, stroking his hair, his ears, his neck.&nbsp; And
the light contact of her fingers maddened him, finding strange
nerves that had never felt before, awakening new yearnings.</p>
<p>At last she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lamp&rsquo;s flaring,&rsquo; she said, in a
curious, toneless voice.&nbsp; Smiling gently she freed herself
from his arms and turned down the wick.&nbsp; He followed her,
feeling that she was escaping him.&nbsp; Never again should she
escape him.&nbsp; Obedient to his will she came back to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Us bain&rsquo;t gooin&rsquo; to wait for the parson,
bin&rsquo; us?&rsquo; he said, and when she would not answer:
&lsquo;Durs&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you, wench?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve waited
above a bit, us two!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the children,&rsquo; she said, lowering
her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought I heard Morgan cry out in his
sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless them!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
don&rsquo;t I love every bone in their bodies as if they was my
own?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know.&nbsp; And
they&rsquo;re so fond of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;m yours,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;So what does it matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me.&nbsp; Poor sweet lambs!&nbsp; Oh,
Abner, where am I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;m here with me, wench!&nbsp; In my
arms.&nbsp; You belong to me, Mary.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nought
can take you away from me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t let you go now
I&rsquo;ve got you.&nbsp; Not a minute, not a second!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t take it in,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If Mrs Mamble could see through the wall!&nbsp; To think
of all that people have said of us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They can say it again.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re welcome
now!&nbsp; Talk?&nbsp; They can talk their damned heads
off.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been through all that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should just think we have,&rsquo; she sighed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They can&rsquo;t touch us now.&nbsp; Abner!&nbsp;
Abner!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>She
clung to him and kissed him again and again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,
Abner, don&rsquo;t ask me!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just let
things happen as they will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She hid her face against him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But afterward,&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
can we do?&nbsp; How can we get away, Abner?&nbsp; I feel as if
something might stop us.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get away at
once.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear
waiting!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed at her.&nbsp; &lsquo;To-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody will know it&rsquo;s any different till
we&rsquo;re gone,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;They can&rsquo;t
say worse of us than they have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They will. . . .&nbsp; Of course they will.&nbsp; They
can&rsquo;t help seeing.&nbsp; Mrs Mamble . . . an old woman like
that sees everything.&nbsp; I shall look different.&nbsp; I know
I shall, if it&rsquo;s only that I&rsquo;m happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed as he kissed her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bin yo&rsquo; happy,
my love?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Abner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three or four days&rsquo;ll see me finished up at old
Williams&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He done us a good turn, and don&rsquo;t
you forget it.&nbsp; Besides that you couldn&rsquo;t get ready by
to-morrow.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll take a few days over that, and
I&rsquo;ll go on and look for a home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Abner!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me now!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you leave
me!&nbsp; If ever I lose sight of you now something will
happen.&nbsp; I know it as sure as sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;m a baby, that&rsquo;s what you are!&rsquo;
he said, teasing.&nbsp; He gathered her up in his arms and talked
foolishly to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, shaking her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
mean it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as serious as I can be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A damned sight too serious for me!&rsquo; he
grumbled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must all go together.&nbsp; In three days I can be
ready.&nbsp; No, two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case every one&rsquo;ll see us.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;m all the other way now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care who sees us now,&rsquo; she said
passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;What does it matter?&nbsp; Let it take
its chance!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing to us.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so
sick of their talk that it means nothing to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>She
became thoughtful once more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner,&rsquo; she said suddenly, &lsquo;tell me truly,
when did you first want me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again he teased her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does that matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to know,&rsquo; she protested.</p>
<p>And he told her of the night at Redlake when he had stood
burning in the moonlight beneath the jasmine-covered windows of
the inn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew, I knew!&rsquo; she said softly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t sleep that night.&nbsp; The time we&rsquo;ve lost,
us two!&nbsp; Oh, how I hate myself!&nbsp; It was nearly the same
with me.&nbsp; Just when we&rsquo;d missed our way and my legs
ached so that I felt I couldn&rsquo;t walk another step.&nbsp;
Poor little Morgan, and the bottle of pop you promised him!&nbsp;
And then those strange sea-birds crying up in the dark.&nbsp; Do
you remember how I turned on you and told you I hated the sight
of you?&nbsp; That was when I loved you.&nbsp; Then and ever
since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been through something, one time and
another,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She laughed softly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s like a long courtship,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;George and I only knew each other six weeks
before we were married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It amazed her to find that now she could speak of George
without discomfort.&nbsp; Her mind ran swiftly over those early
days.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I feel sorry for George
now, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of him!&rsquo; said Abner
seriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re jealous . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of him.&nbsp; I gave old George my
word.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve not been a pal to George.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a funny boy,&rsquo; she said, loving him
with her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to forget old George,&rsquo; he said
obstinately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t speak of him, Abner.&nbsp; What time
is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put her hand into his waistcoat pocket and took out his
watch.&nbsp; The sweet familiarity of the action entranced
him.&nbsp; His eyes followed her fingers, and the newly conscious
turn of her head as she looked at it.</p>
<p><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>&lsquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She rose, and again she abandoned herself to his arms.&nbsp;
Then she left him suddenly and went before him, never looking
back.&nbsp; He followed with the little lamp in his hand.&nbsp;
At the foot of the stairs he stopped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; she whispered,
turning.&nbsp; &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a step outside,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Some one on the garden path.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whoever can it be at this time?&nbsp; Take the light to
the door and see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The darkness of the staircase engulfed her as he opened the
kitchen door and peered outside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he called.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that you, Abner?&rsquo; a voice replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now I thought I see&rsquo;d a light.&nbsp; I guessed
you&rsquo;d have gone up over by this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want, Mr Drew?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You wait while I do get my breath back,&rsquo; said the
old man.&nbsp; He had evidently been drinking and walked
unsteadily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s better!&nbsp; Well,
Abner, I&rsquo;ve a&rsquo; been down to the Buffalo to-night for
a quart, and I thought as how I&rsquo;d bring &rsquo;ee a bit of
downright good news I heared.&nbsp; Yes, old Mrs Malpas
she&rsquo;ve got news from Shrewsbury&mdash;whether it be by
letter or word of mouth I can&rsquo;t say for certain&mdash;as
young George have behaved himself so well into prison that
they&rsquo;m going to knock off part of his time.&nbsp; Any day
this week he may be coming home along, so they says, and I
thought I&rsquo;d better bring the news quick to his
missus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coming home . . .?&rsquo; said Abner, dazed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not onusual, they do say.&nbsp;
If she&rsquo;s abed you can tell her in the marnin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Wish &rsquo;ee good-night, Abner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her.&nbsp; Thank&rsquo;ee for looking
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only
natural.&nbsp; Good-night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-night, Mr Drew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He closed the door.&nbsp; The light fell on Mary, standing
pale at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s coming back,&rsquo; said Abner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard.&nbsp; When?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t say certain.&nbsp; In a day or
two.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>&lsquo;Abner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there it is!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re only just in time,
my girl.&rsquo;&nbsp; She stood mute, paralysed.&nbsp; He wished
she would speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good your standing there,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go on up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hold the
lamp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not move.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t take it in,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>He put the lamp down on the table again and held out his
arms.</p>
<p>Still she did not move.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary . . .!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed, came to his arms, shuddering, shaken with sobs,
and through her tears he kissed her, comforting: &lsquo;Mary,
don&rsquo;t cry now, don&rsquo;t cry . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did I tell you?&rsquo; she wailed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Abner, I knew, I knew!&nbsp; I told you something would
happen.&nbsp; Thank God it came in time!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve not a
minute to think.&nbsp; Two or three days!&nbsp; Abner, we
<i>must</i> go to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer her, for his mind was deeply troubled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I can manage if you leave it to me,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; He held her closer.&nbsp; &lsquo;What does it matter
if we take nothing away?&nbsp; Only just a few clothes for me and
the children.&nbsp; I can leave everything tidy, just as it was
when he went.&rsquo;&nbsp; She hesitated, for she remembered the
tea-set that she had pawned in Shrewsbury.&nbsp; He would miss
that.&nbsp; Then she realised, thankfully, that it was her
wedding present, not his.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nearly everything,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s better that we should
start with nothing?&nbsp; In lodgings at first.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t
it be strange?&rsquo;&nbsp; She laughed softly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
not a soul to know!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s beginning life all over
again.&nbsp; Oh, Abner, my love!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she spoke, confidently, at times almost gaily, and he made
believe that he was listening to her, humouring her
childishness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And isn&rsquo;t it lucky,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that
Mr Drew&rsquo;s working up at the Pentre.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t
need to go there yourself.&nbsp; If you get up early you can
catch him before he goes and send up a message to the farm.&nbsp;
It isn&rsquo;t as if it <a name="page369"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 369</span>mattered your breaking your word to
Mr Williams.&nbsp; People must make allowances, mustn&rsquo;t
they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer her, and she became conscious of his
brooding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s up with you?&nbsp; Tell
me!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re frightening me.&nbsp; Abner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go to-morrow,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Abner, we must, we must!&nbsp; Two or three days,
he said.&nbsp; He might even be a day early.&nbsp; He might come
to-morrow.&nbsp; Think of it, Abner!&nbsp; I should
die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If George is coming home like that we can&rsquo;t
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, are you mad?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s come over
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Naught&rsquo;s come over
me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hearing his name sudden like that.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s like a judgment.&nbsp; It makes you think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Judgment!&rsquo; she scoffed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Abner,
haven&rsquo;t we thought enough?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t we been
thinking for six months?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sick of
thinking!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like a warning.&nbsp; Just the very second.&nbsp; If
he&rsquo;d come an hour later . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the difference, Abner?&nbsp; If he&rsquo;d
come to-morrow or in a week&rsquo;s time it would be no
different.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d made up our minds, Abner, we&rsquo;re
not children.&nbsp; Things like that don&rsquo;t count.&nbsp;
Whether you&rsquo;ve had me or not, I&rsquo;m yours.&nbsp; You
know that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She clung closer to him, but his mind would not accept the
sway of her emotion.&nbsp; He freed himself from her hands, and
the movement swept her into a passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do
that!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll kill me . . . kill
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;George is my pal,&rsquo; he said stolidly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I gave old George my word.&nbsp; We shook hands on it,
George and me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Abner,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;m the only pal I&rsquo;ve got that I can
trust.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rsquo; she cried, and her
voice went shrill.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it?&nbsp; What
children men are!&nbsp; Gave George your word!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you see that you&rsquo;ve broken your word already . . . broken
it long ago, ever since you thought of me like that?&nbsp; And
then you say you love me!&nbsp; That isn&rsquo;t love, Abner, not
my kind anyway!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He caught her up in his arms, and she could not speak now for
tears.&nbsp; His own face was anguished.</p>
<p><a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
370</span>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better kill me and have done with
it,&rsquo; she sobbed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Far better.&nbsp; Oh, why
don&rsquo;t you kill me right out if you&rsquo;re going to leave
me?&nbsp; I wish I were dead!&nbsp; I do!&nbsp; Abner, if we
don&rsquo;t go away to-morrow I shall lose you.&nbsp; I know it .
. . I know it!&nbsp; For my sake, Abner!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had so
little happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He fondled her as she spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going
to leave go of you,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
ever think that!&rsquo;&nbsp; He kissed her tearful face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I gave old George my word,&rsquo; he continued
obstinately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, damn your word!&rsquo; she cried, violently
wrenching herself away from him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t get wild,&rsquo; he protested.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Listen to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t listen.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re talking
wickedly, madly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to listen, my girl!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
took hold of her and held her with his strength.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
chap may go back on his word.&nbsp; Every one knows that.&nbsp;
But a man that&rsquo;s worth calling don&rsquo;t go slinking away
behind another chap&rsquo;s back like a dog.&nbsp; If old George
is coming home he&rsquo;s got to hear what I say to his face, not
find the place empty and say I&rsquo;ve run away from him.&nbsp;
Me and George has got to have this out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then take us away first,&rsquo; she pleaded, &lsquo;and
come back to see him afterward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;m talking soft now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m frightened, Abner . . .
frightened!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve no need to be while I&rsquo;m here.&nbsp;
I can look after myself and you too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to see
old George and tell him straight.&nbsp; You may like it or lump
it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She wept, inconsolable.&nbsp; She would not let him comfort
her.&nbsp; She hoped that her tears would soften him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you do just one thing for me, Abner?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re cruel . . . cruel!&nbsp;&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t love
me.&nbsp; That isn&rsquo;t love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do it my own way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might just as well kill me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never run away from a man yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t take me away from here now,&rsquo;
she said desperately, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll never have me at
all.&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; I know it, Abner, it&rsquo;s our last
chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s been too much for you,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t see anything clear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a
chap that changes.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 371</span>She
stared at him in silence with sad, resentful eyes.&nbsp; Then she
lost control of herself and began to curse the clumsiness of old
Drew, who had blundered in on them with his drunken gossip in the
middle of the night.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive
him!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never!&rsquo;&nbsp; She
shouted like a drunken woman.&nbsp; Then she stopped and listened
intently, just as an animal listens in suspicion.&nbsp; Morgan,
awakened by the sound of raised voices, had begun to cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s Morgan,&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better go to him,&rsquo; Abner replied.</p>
<p>She put her hands to her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Abner,
don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re driving me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on!&rsquo; he said roughly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
put the light out.&nbsp; Got the matches?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She saw that he meant it, and blindly went.</p>
<p>Slowly, methodically, Abner locked the kitchen door and put
out the light.&nbsp; A moment later he himself went upstairs in
the dark.&nbsp; Morgan was still sobbing, mechanically, for the
sake of hearing his own voice, and as Abner passed the door he
was aware of a soft moaning which told him that Mary was crying
too.&nbsp; His heart ached, his body yearned for her; but in his
brain George Malpas&rsquo;s words re-echoed: &lsquo;By God,
you&rsquo;re the only pal I&rsquo;ve got that I can
trust!&rsquo;&nbsp; In a day or two George would be home, and
then the situation must be faced.&nbsp; He could not be a man and
run away from it.</p>
<p>He got into bed.&nbsp; Lying there in the dark, listening to
the ceaseless creaking of the boards and joists, he cursed
himself for a fool.&nbsp; His body was on fire.&nbsp; He knew
that he could not possibly sleep, and guessed that Mary surely
was awake.&nbsp; He was a damned, soft fool, and nothing
more!&nbsp; Lying there with eyes open, staring at the darkness,
it seemed to him that he heard a soft step on the stairs.&nbsp;
The latch of his door started.&nbsp; His heart dissolved within
him.&nbsp; He leapt out of bed, trembling, tingling in every
limb.&nbsp; Mary had been wiser.&nbsp; He knew it.&nbsp; She had
come to him for comfort.&nbsp; She was his.&nbsp; In a moment she
would be sinking warm into his arms.&nbsp; His scruples vanished
like a puff of smoke.&nbsp; He heard himself swallow, heard his
breath <a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>coming in short grunts.&nbsp; He opened the door to
meet her, to take her.&nbsp; The stair was empty and dark.&nbsp;
A rat scuttled away in the wainscot.&nbsp; A dank, wintry air
possessed the house.&nbsp; He slammed the door to, viciously.</p>
<p>Next morning, before Mary had stirred from her bed, he had set
out as usual for the Pentre.</p>
<h2><a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>The
Twenty-Fourth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the same day, at noon, George
Malpas paraded before the Governor of Shrewsbury Jail to take his
discharge.&nbsp; The interview was short, almost friendly.&nbsp;
The prisoner had behaved well throughout his term, the chaplain
had reported on him as a young man of superior intelligence, and
for these reasons a remission of a quarter of his sentence had
been recommended and sanctioned.&nbsp; From the governor&rsquo;s
office he was marched across the rigid quadrangle that he knew
and hated to another room where he signed a receipt for the
personal belongings that had been taken from him in the
Lesswardine police-court and now miraculously reappeared.&nbsp; A
warder checked them as each was handed out:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One watch.&nbsp; Silver chain with medal.&nbsp; One
packet of letters.&nbsp; One notebook and lead pencil.&nbsp; One
steel foot-rule, folding.&nbsp; Four shillings and twopence,
silver and copper.&nbsp; One pocket-knife.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
paused.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>George Malpas was seized with a sudden anxiety.&nbsp; He tried
to speak; but long familiarity with the ways of warders made him
frightened to use his tongue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not half!&rsquo; said the other, with a wink.&nbsp;
&lsquo;One leather wallet.&nbsp; Fifty pounds in Bank of England
notes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s something like!&rsquo; said the
other, handing it to George with a wink.</p>
<p>He thrust it into the breast pocket of the coat which had been
placed that morning in his cell, and the action gave him an
unfamiliar thrill.&nbsp; What a thing it was to have pockets!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Malpas, it&rsquo;s good-bye, then,&rsquo; said
the warder, who was also a humorist.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look in any
time you&rsquo;re passing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>George Malpas did not smile.&nbsp; They showed him out of a
small doorway at the side of the arch under which the prison vans
came grinding in.&nbsp; From his cell he had been able to hear
the sound of the horses&rsquo; shoes sliding on the stone.&nbsp;
He saw a street along which <a name="page374"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 374</span>free men were moving with a rapt,
purposive hurry.&nbsp; Sometimes a passer-by would turn and look
up idly at the great nail-studded doors and the fan of spikes
that surmounted them.&nbsp; George had never seen the gateway
before.&nbsp; He only knew the jail as a heavy building
dominating the hill above the station.&nbsp; When they had
brought him handcuffed from the train, humiliated, wondering if
it were worth while wrenching himself free and throwing his body
on the rails, they had driven him to the prison in a black
van.&nbsp; Now he stood undetermined, not knowing which way to
take.&nbsp; Over the hill-side the city of Shrewsbury sprawled:
spires, chimney-pots, towers, and smoke stacks blowing in a free
and windy sky.&nbsp; Not a leaf on the trees, and black,
unfriendly dust whirling along brick pavements.</p>
<p>He shivered.&nbsp; For some reason his newly-pressed clothes
hung loose and damp upon him.&nbsp; He must have lost
flesh.&nbsp; Of course he had lost flesh.&nbsp; Who
wouldn&rsquo;t after fourteen months in jail?&nbsp; A cart came
slowly past him with a load of horse manure.&nbsp; A good smell .
. . a country smell!&nbsp; The driver cracked his whip, and the
noise made George Malpas jump.&nbsp; That was a bad sign
surely!&nbsp; The sooner he got a drink and steadied his nerves
the better.&nbsp; He looked up and down the road for the sign of
a public-house.&nbsp; A hundred yards away a strip of hoarding
with gilt letters topped the sky-line of a red brick
building.&nbsp; Astill&rsquo;s Celebrated Entire, it said.&nbsp;
Brummagem beer was better than nothing.&nbsp; He crossed the road
with long strides, but a dog-cart driven fast down the middle of
the street made him pause.&nbsp; There was a bicycle behind it,
and he did not think he could avoid both.&nbsp; People should not
be allowed to drive so furiously.</p>
<p>He reached the public-house and thanked God for his
escape.&nbsp; He felt that in gaining the shelter of its walls he
was doing more than sheltering from the bitter wind and the
dust.&nbsp; He grew surer of himself, cracked a joke with the
barmaid, and paid for his beer.&nbsp; The florin that she
tendered him in change for a half-crown looked like a foreign
coin.&nbsp; He examined it suspiciously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
of these new ones.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite a change to get the
Prince of Wales&rsquo; head, <a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think he looks half the man of King Edward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he agreed.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, he
don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; He examined the coin, bewildered.&nbsp;
Then, fearing that she must read the whole of his story in his
ignorance, he pocketed his money and darted out into the street
again.&nbsp; It was strange how a broken habit reasserted
itself.&nbsp; He put his hand in his unfamiliar waistcoat pocket
and pulled out his watch.&nbsp; Nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; That
was impossible.&nbsp; He laughed, realising that his watch had
run down at its usual winding time on the night of his
arrest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m like a fool,&rsquo; he thought.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
dull, useless.&nbsp; I want another drink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gradually, under the influence of the liquor, his confidence
returned.&nbsp; It must be market day in Shrewsbury, he thought,
for the streets were so full of people; but reflection told him
that Shrewsbury market is not held on a Monday and that the crowd
that moved on the pavements of the steep high street was no more
than the normal week-day traffic.&nbsp; It gave him a thrill of
pleasure to realise that people were not staring at him.&nbsp; He
was encouraged to slacken his pace, to walk no longer as if some
one were pursuing him.&nbsp; He stared in several shop windows,
and at last found himself gazing at his own image in a long
mirror.&nbsp; It gave him a start to find himself facing an
elongated lath of a man that he did not know, until he realised
that the mirror was a convex affair placed as an advertisement
outside an eating-house to emphasise the contrast between a man
who had fed there and one who had not.&nbsp; It was not such a
bad idea.&nbsp; He would go in and eat his first square meal.</p>
<p>The place was nearly empty, for Shrewsbury does not dine till
one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; They brought him steak and kidney
pudding, the best that he had ever tasted, and a pint of half and
half.&nbsp; He began to feel a man again.&nbsp; He called the
waiter for a second drink and ordered, with it, a local
time-table.&nbsp; Looking through it at leisure he found that the
trains to Llandwlas had not been altered, though there was now
time to get a drink in the change at Craven Arms.&nbsp; If he
caught the afternoon train he would have time to look about
Shrewsbury <a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
376</span>for another two hours and see to certain business
matters that were in the back of his mind.</p>
<p>He paid his bill, gave the waiter a liberal tip, and walked up
the hill past the half-timbered houses to the main street.&nbsp;
He wondered if the place was where it used to be.&nbsp; Yes, it
was still there.&nbsp; It pleased him to think that he
hadn&rsquo;t lost his memory.&nbsp; Nothing would have surprised
him after all those useless, numbing months.&nbsp; Above the shop
door was the inscription: &lsquo;Emigration Office.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Inside, a long counter, backed by posters of shipping companies,
and a single yawning clerk who had been left in charge during the
luncheon hour.&nbsp; He asked George what he could do for
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Canada,&rsquo; said George.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want to know
all about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man produced a sheaf of circulars and began to
explain.&nbsp; He found it difficult to place the applicant, his
pale face, his hat jammed on his head to hide the prison crop,
his equivocal hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you a mechanic?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. Farmer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clerk stared at him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Farmer?&nbsp; You want
to buy land?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I want to work on it.&nbsp; I
have a little money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Taking the missus with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have to get two references for an assisted passage,
you know,&rsquo; said the clerk, producing a form.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t wait for any
rubbish of that kind.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the fare,
steerage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clerk looked it up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Liverpool, Quebec.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what you want,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then you
get right over to Calgary if you take my advice.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
write it all down for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did so, in a sloped, flourishing hand, on the back of one
of the circulars.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get the Allan boat
from Liverpool Saturday week,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; George
thanked him and plunged out into the street.</p>
<p><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>At
the station he bought a daily paper, the North Bromwich
<i>Courier</i>.&nbsp; As usual on Monday it was full of
football.&nbsp; Albion at the top of the first league: Notts
Forest, second.&nbsp; Strange clubs from the Southern League had
invaded that sanctuary: the season was half over, and they were
shaping well.&nbsp; He read words that meant nothing to
him.&nbsp; He could not concentrate, for he had drunk as much as
was good for him.&nbsp; The platform seemed to him a noisy,
exposed situation; for he could not yet be at his ease in a
crowd.&nbsp; He started at the sound of a familiar voice speaking
the word Lesswardine.&nbsp; A man passed him in a drab
covert-coat: Mr Prosser of The Dyke, talking to young
Maddy.&nbsp; They had not recognised him.&nbsp; He slipped into a
urinal to avoid them and waited there till he heard the
south-bound train roll in.&nbsp; Then he made a dash for a
non-smoking carriage and hid himself behind his newspaper in the
corner.&nbsp; The train was not full, and to his great relief no
one entered his compartment.</p>
<p>They started smoothly and soon left Shrewsbury behind.&nbsp; A
wintry landscape unfolded on either side of him: the low bow of
the Wrekin; Caer Caradoc, a sheer crag on the left; the cloven
bastions of the Long Mynd.&nbsp; He threw up the window and drank
in great draughts of hill air.&nbsp; He laughed to see the green
of the fields and the gray, monstrous hills.&nbsp; But he knew
that he was a stranger.&nbsp; The country that he rejoiced to see
had rejected him.&nbsp; If he lived to be a hundred not a single
man of his acquaintance would forget that he had spent a year in
jail.&nbsp; As soon as he should have left Craven Arms the hills
would fold him in, draw him within the confines of his old
life.&nbsp; He was free, but this could never be a real
freedom.&nbsp; A wider country, a new life, Canada. . . .&nbsp;
He was dying for a drink.</p>
<p>At Craven Arms the satisfaction of this desire did not seem
easy, for others were before him in the Refreshment Room and
every moment his chance of meeting Lesswardine people
increased.&nbsp; He took a flask of brandy from the counter and
paid for it without waiting for the change.&nbsp; The local train
stood humbly in the siding.&nbsp; He chose a carriage already
full of Radnor farmers whom he did not know.&nbsp; He drank <a
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>down the
whole of his flask of brandy, and then fell into a kind of doze
lulled by the sing-song voices of his companions.&nbsp; The train
twisted along the valley in the dark, pulling up with a jolt at
every upland station.&nbsp; At Llandwlas he turned out in a hurry
and handed his ticket to a new porter, who stood at the gate in
the dusk swinging a lantern.&nbsp; Men were shouting, driving
bullocks into a pen.&nbsp; A trap was waiting with the lamps
already lit.&nbsp; He avoided their light, but guessed by the
colour of the horse and the erect figure of the driver that
Marion was waiting for Mr Prosser.&nbsp; A year before he might
have dared to ask for a lift to Chapel Green.&nbsp; God, how
strange, how hauntingly strange the country smelt!</p>
<p>An hour later he staggered into the bar at the Buffalo.&nbsp;
Mrs Malpas, a withered, pathetic figure, half the size of the
woman whom he remembered, gave a cry and ran to meet him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My son, my son!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her, laughing heavily, blowing gusts of brandy into
her eyes.&nbsp; She would not think of the spirit in his
breath.&nbsp; Her hands caressed his face.&nbsp; She turned him
to the light to see if he were changed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, George, you&rsquo;re that thin!&nbsp; They
haven&rsquo;t fed you proper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He freed himself from her.&nbsp; &lsquo;How&rsquo;s
dad?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The same as ever, George.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor old devil!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She drew him into the bar-parlour where the old man was
sitting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s George, my dear,&rsquo; she cried
excitedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s our George!&rsquo;</p>
<p>George slapped his father on the back: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know me, dad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man only mumbled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone downhill,&rsquo; said George.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been with him all the time.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t see the change like I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; she said listlessly.&nbsp; She could
not keep her eyes from her son.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re thin,
George, so thin!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then give us a drop of beer, mother.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;ll help fatten me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could not refuse him.&nbsp; While she was filling the <a
name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>tankard at
the counter old Drew and another labourer from the Pentre who had
been driving Williams&rsquo;s bullocks to Llandwlas station came
into the bar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My son&rsquo;s home,&rsquo; she told them gaily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And so thin!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a scandal.&nbsp; They starve
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I&rsquo;ve always heard tell, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo;
said Drew, with a wink.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s his
health.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; George asked anxiously.&nbsp;
He still found it difficult to resist the impulse of hiding
himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t see,&rsquo; Mrs Malpas lied.</p>
<p>She gave George his beer, and he settled down to it.&nbsp; The
two labourers spoke spasmodically in the bar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, mother,&rsquo; he said at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell
us how things have been going on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Malpas pursed her lips.&nbsp; &lsquo;Going on!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the word.&nbsp; I wrote to you, George.&nbsp; You
got my letter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I got that all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Malpas grew intense.&nbsp; Her hands trembled with
emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a bad woman, George.&nbsp;
Downright bad.&nbsp; I told you so before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not another kid waiting for me, no
surprise packet of that kind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s that deceitful, George.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s no better than her father.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t
have used you worse than she has.&nbsp; So open!&nbsp; You never
made a worse mistake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You let me teach her!&rsquo; said George between his
teeth.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll learn her her bleeding
duty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t swear, George!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ought to be more shocked at her than me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that Fellows is no better.&nbsp; Rotten bad.&nbsp;
Always going after women.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Susie
Hind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s welcome!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Mr Prosser&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; They had to turn
him off The Dyke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her?&rsquo; George laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a
proper young bull!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And all the time living as man and wife with
Mary.&nbsp; Laughing at you, the two of them, behind your
back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see to that!&rsquo; said George
grimly.&nbsp; The liquor was spreading in hot fumes through his
brain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you won&rsquo;t go up to-night, George,&rsquo; she
said anxiously.</p>
<p><a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; You bet I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d best stay here, George.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you go near her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll talk you round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll shut her mouth for her.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll
get level with him too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old woman grew alarmed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go near them, George,&rsquo; she
pleaded.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a home for you here.&nbsp;
Leave them to it.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not worth taking the notice
of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about the kids, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fellows will have set them again you.&nbsp; They
won&rsquo;t know you.&nbsp; You see!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He grew excited.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I tell you, if I have to do
time again I&rsquo;m going to put that b&mdash; on his
back!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He put down his tankard with another oath.&nbsp; One of the
drinkers in the bar knocked at the counter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep still till I&rsquo;m back, George.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t be a minute,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get us another pint, then,&rsquo; George grumbled.</p>
<p>She took his tankard, and having given the labourers their
change and wished them good-night, she brought it back to him
filled.&nbsp; God would forgive her this sin.&nbsp; Even if he
were drunk she wanted to keep him at the Buffalo, for she dreaded
Abner&rsquo;s strength.&nbsp; When she returned he was still on
his feet, talking indistinctly to the old man, who was shaken by
a fit of coughing that choked him.&nbsp; She thumped his
back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, dad,&rsquo; said George.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Better out than in!&rsquo;&nbsp; The joke appeared to
please him.</p>
<p>She drew him down gently to his chair and gave him the
tankard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit down, my dear,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want
to talk to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done talking,&rsquo; said George
obstinately.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me get at him: that&rsquo;s what I
want.&nbsp; Let me get at the dirty pair of them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She bent over him and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The money, George,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where
did you put it?&nbsp; She told me you hadn&rsquo;t hid it in the
house, but I reckon she lied to me, or they couldn&rsquo;t have
lived all this time with him out of work.&nbsp; They must have
got at it.&nbsp; Where did you put it, my son?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>He
stared at her with affected stupidity.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
money?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fifty pounds.&nbsp; Out of my box.&nbsp; I guessed it
was you that had it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t dare
tell the police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good old woman!&nbsp; I knew you
wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a good mother.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll say that for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you can give it back to me.&nbsp; Give it to me,
my son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His cunning returned to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lost it, mother.&nbsp; Every penny.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone?&nbsp; Fifty pounds?&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t lose
it, George.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You try backing horses, and you&rsquo;ll see,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Racing, too!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, George,
George!&nbsp; It was all I had.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got me, mother,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What more do you want?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no
good crying over spilt milk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She came to his arms, weakly sobbing, and clung to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t go crying all over me,&rsquo; he said
thickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Loose me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;George, you mustn&rsquo;t go, dear.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
not fit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m going.&nbsp; Leave hold of
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;George!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you say I&rsquo;m drunk?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll show you
if I&rsquo;m drunk!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still she clung to him.&nbsp; He gave her a push and she went
over into the hearth with a clatter of fire-irons.&nbsp; The old
man began to wail in a high-pitched voice: &lsquo;Help!&nbsp;
Help!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shut your damned mouth, you!&rsquo; said George.</p>
<p>He blundered out into the bar, knocking against the end of the
counter and bringing down a tray of glasses with a crash.&nbsp; A
freakish idea seized him.&nbsp; He took the key from the door and
locked it on the outside.&nbsp; He shook with laughter at the
joke.</p>
<p>A young moon sank slowly over the misty woodland.&nbsp; He
stopped in the middle of the road and solemnly turned over the
packet of banknotes in his pocket for luck.&nbsp; Drunk?&nbsp;
Not he!&nbsp; He was sharp enough to think of everything.&nbsp;
He turned his uncertain steps toward Wolfpits.</p>
<p><a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
382</span>Before him, with half an hour in hand, old Drew went
pounding along the same road as fast as his rheumatic knees would
let him.&nbsp; He reached Wolfpits breathless and knocked
violently at Mary&rsquo;s kitchen door.&nbsp; She was upstairs,
putting the children to bed.&nbsp; Morgan was tucked in already,
and Gladys was having her hair brushed.&nbsp; Panic seized Mary
when she heard the old man&rsquo;s knock.&nbsp; Those rapid blows
seemed to her to herald catastrophe.&nbsp; She ran downstairs and
came to the door with an ashen face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey, missus,&rsquo; Drew panted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be Abner
in there with &rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he&rsquo;s not back yet,&rsquo; she said,
relieved.&nbsp; Then, as a new fear chilled her:
&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t he at the Pentre?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most like he be,&rsquo; said Drew, slowly regaining his
breath and leaning on the doorpost.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been
a driving they bullocks to Llandwlas station.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at the clock.&nbsp; It was a little earlier than
Abner&rsquo;s usual hour of return.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better wait if you want him.&nbsp; Take a seat, Mr
Drew.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be back in a few minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must stop &rsquo;en . . . you must stop
&rsquo;en!&rsquo; said the old man impressively.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
he come down over the field I shall meet &rsquo;en myself.&nbsp;
But often he do come by the road.&nbsp; You must send some one to
stop &rsquo;en that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop him?&nbsp; What do you mean?&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must stop &rsquo;en.&nbsp; Your George be coming up
from the Buffalo, mad with the drink.&nbsp; You must stop
Abner.&nbsp; Keep him away, or there&rsquo;ll be murder done,
sure &lsquo;nuff!&nbsp; Murder!&nbsp; You take my word for
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I stop him?&nbsp; What can I do, Mr
Drew?&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go yourself, missus.&nbsp; Or send Mrs Mamble.&nbsp;
Her&rsquo;ll run along for &rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. I must wait for George,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>An inspiration came to her.&nbsp; She took a piece of paper
and scribbled a note to Abner, telling him that George was
coming, begging him, for her sake, to keep out of the way until
she had seen him.&nbsp; Then she called upstairs:
&lsquo;Gladys!&rsquo; and the child came down with her hair
plaited for the night.</p>
<p><a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
383</span>&lsquo;Come here, my darling,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Put your shoes on.&nbsp; I want you to go down to the
corner and meet Abner and give this to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather dark, mam?&rsquo; said Gladys,
thrilled by the prospect of adventure.&nbsp; She shivered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my darling.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a lovely moon,
isn&rsquo;t there, Mr Drew?&nbsp; Just wait at the bottom of the
drive till he comes, or go a little way up the road.&nbsp; Let me
put your coat on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She helped the child into her overcoat and kissed her.&nbsp;
Gladys took the note.&nbsp; &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t our Abner be
surprised?&rsquo; she said, as she went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d best bide along with you, missus,&rsquo; said
old Drew darkly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather you went, Mr Drew,&rsquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you mean it kindly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear, I&rsquo;ll be going on up to the
Pentre.&nbsp; Maybe I&rsquo;ll meet Abner up the fields.&nbsp;
Shall I send Mrs Mamble in to &rsquo;ee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. Mrs Mamble&rsquo;s out: gone to the shops in
Lesswardine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather be alone when he comes.&nbsp;
It was good of you to warn me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He left her, and she waited.&nbsp; Her brain followed the
messenger down the avenue step by step.&nbsp; She realised that
the most awful moment of her life was upon her.&nbsp; She
wondered if she ought to pray.&nbsp; She could not pray.&nbsp;
What right had she, a guilty woman, to call on Divine help?&nbsp;
She must fight for herself.&nbsp; She looked at the clock.&nbsp;
Barely two minutes had passed since she had looked before.&nbsp;
Surely Abner could not be long.</p>
<p>Her strained ears heard steps in the distance.&nbsp; She
peered out into the moonlight.&nbsp; Two dim figures were
visible.&nbsp; Abner, in his obstinate folly, had seen her note
and refused her warning.&nbsp; Even now there was time to stop
him.&nbsp; She dared not call, for it struck her that George
might well be coming up behind him.&nbsp; She stood, trembling
with impatience, waiting for him to come within earshot.&nbsp;
The figures of the man and the child became more distinct.&nbsp;
His gait was unsteady but too fast for Gladys, who ran at his
side.&nbsp; He carried her note unfolded.&nbsp; The paper showed
white in the moonlight.&nbsp; They came toward her, and she saw
that <a name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>it
was George.&nbsp; A cry came from her lips.&nbsp; He left the
child behind him, stalked straight into the kitchen and flung his
hat on the table.&nbsp; He was as pale as death; his cropped head
shaped like a skull.&nbsp; The walk had partially sobered
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go straight upstairs, Gladys,&rsquo; she called.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s dad, mam.&nbsp; I give him Abner&rsquo;s
note.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go upstairs as I tell you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gladys&rsquo;s mouth fell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, mam?&rsquo; she
faltered.</p>
<p>George pulled a chair toward him and flopped into it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You be said!&rsquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>The child ran upstairs, frightened.&nbsp; George sat on, his
eyes staring savagely at her out of his sunken orbits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mary,&rsquo; he said at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
is a bloody fine game!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could not speak for her increasing terror.&nbsp; She had
never felt so frightened of him in her life.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
looks like a criminal,&rsquo; she thought.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak up,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;ve
you got to say for yourself.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the meaning of
this?&rsquo;&nbsp; He held out her note.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell him to
keep away, would you?&nbsp; You dirty bitch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;George,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
believe all people tell you.&nbsp; You know your mother&rsquo;s
against me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold your noise about my mother!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a
good woman, she is, and a good wife.&nbsp; The likes of
you&rsquo;s not fit to go near her.&nbsp; I know what&rsquo;s
been going on here without her telling me.&nbsp; Sleeping with
the lodger!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you deny it, or I&rsquo;ll bash
your mouth in for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, George, never!&rsquo; she cried, passionately
righteous.&nbsp; &lsquo;I swear by God as I&rsquo;m standing
here, it never came to that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can swear by the devil for all I care.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve finished with you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s him I
want!&rsquo;&nbsp; His voice left him.&nbsp; He cleared his
throat and spat viciously in the fire.</p>
<p>Mary pulled her senses together.&nbsp; &lsquo;George,&rsquo;
she said, &lsquo;have you ever known me tell you a
lie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never knew a woman who wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he
said, with a laugh.</p>
<p>She let his speech pass.&nbsp; &lsquo;Imagine the hard times
we&rsquo;ve had,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;and not so much as a
word <a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>from you!&nbsp; Not a penny in the house!&nbsp; The way
he&rsquo;s worked for us and suffered for us, and all for the
sake of the word he gave you.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a man in a
million who&rsquo;d have done it!&nbsp; And all for
nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All for nothing!&rsquo; he mocked: &lsquo;tell that to
some one else!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without him we should have starved . . . me and the
children.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see that for yourself?&nbsp; And
yet you believe the first word that&rsquo;s spoken against him
and me.&nbsp; You ought to go down on your knees to him and thank
him for what he&rsquo;s done.&nbsp; If it hadn&rsquo;t been for
him you&rsquo;d have found us all in the workhouse.&nbsp; George,
you must believe me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, shut your bloody mouth!&rsquo; he said, rising
clumsily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;George, you must!&rsquo; she repeated.&nbsp; She put
her hand on his shoulder, but he pushed her away.&nbsp; Both of
them heard a step on the path.&nbsp; She made a last, desperate
effort.&nbsp; &lsquo;George, if you touch him . . . &lsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you . . .!</p>
<p>Abner stood in the doorway.&nbsp; His face was solemn and
heavily lined.&nbsp; The sight of Malpas did not seem to disturb
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallo, George,&rsquo; he said, in a thick voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How goes it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk to me!&rsquo; said George,
threateningly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You wait till I&rsquo;ve told you
what I think of you, you damned swine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Abner flushed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Steady, George!&nbsp; Go steady!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got
to talk this over.&nbsp; You sit down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a sight too much talk about the both of
you,&rsquo; George snarled.&nbsp; &lsquo;When you&rsquo;ve broke
up a man&rsquo;s home behind his back and then tell him to take a
seat in it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to give you your lesson before
you get kicked out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made a threatening movement toward Abner, who watched him
closely.&nbsp; Spider came dancing into the room.&nbsp; She leapt
up at Abner with little yelps of joy at his return, licking his
hand.&nbsp; At this sight the anger that smouldered in
George&rsquo;s brain leapt into flame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not only the wife and the kids,&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve <a name="page386"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 386</span>got round the lot of them, even the
bleeding dog!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He snatched up the poker and hit out at Spider.&nbsp; Abner
took the blow on his thigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, drop that!&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>But George&rsquo;s senses had left him.&nbsp; He flew at
Abner, raining desperate blows at his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;George!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll kill him!&rsquo; Mary
screamed.</p>
<p>Abner had picked up a chair and protected himself as best he
could.&nbsp; For a second the two men stood staring at one
another, panting for breath.&nbsp; Then another gust of anger
swept over George and he made for Abner again.&nbsp; Mary tried
to throw herself between them, but Abner flung her aside.&nbsp;
The legs of the chair were splintered under George&rsquo;s
blows.&nbsp; He continued to lash out, and it was as much as
Abner could do to defend himself.&nbsp; He saw that the
man&rsquo;s flushed brain meant murder, nothing less.&nbsp;
Somehow he must put an end to this madness.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s
hobnails slithered on the stone flags.&nbsp; Abner took his
chance, and timed his blow.&nbsp; George went down with a groan:
his poker sang like a tuning fork on the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, Abner, what have you done?&rsquo; Mary
cried.&nbsp; She ran to George and bent over him, pulling up his
head.&nbsp; Abner, with black blood dripping from a bruised vein
on his forehead, stood back.&nbsp; The corners of his mouth
twitched with his violent breathing: he still held his chair
uplifted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was him or me,&rsquo; he panted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve killed
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not he!&nbsp; That sort don&rsquo;t die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he himself was anxious for a moment and stooped over
George&rsquo;s body, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. He&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Just knocked out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been like that
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can we do?&rsquo; she cried, staring at him with
frightened eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave him alone.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll come
round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sent you a note by Gladys,&rsquo; she said
inconsequently.&nbsp; &lsquo;He met her and took it off
her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d told you to keep away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I&rsquo;d had it it would have made no
difference.&nbsp; <a name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
387</span>You can&rsquo;t stop a thing like this.&nbsp; Get up
and put your things on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on
him.&nbsp; Get the children dressed and all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him as though she couldn&rsquo;t take in what he
was saying.&nbsp; She was still holding one of George&rsquo;s
inanimate hands that she had clutched in her first anxiety.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dress them, Abner?&nbsp; What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s time we cleared.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t
hurt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t leave him like this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took her arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do what I tell you.&nbsp; Go
on!&nbsp; The sooner we clear the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, we can&rsquo;t turn out in the middle of the
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t come to
no harm.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll look after you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, I can&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she wailed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re asking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s either go now or stay altogether.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t stop here.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s clear enough.&nbsp; If
you and me are going together we must go now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, my dear, I can&rsquo;t face it.&nbsp; Not after
this.&nbsp; Abner, I&rsquo;m too frightened to move a step.&nbsp;
And if he died . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you he&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll come
round sober.&nbsp; If I was to wait for that there&rsquo;d be no
end to it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;d begin all over again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gazed at him, anguished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Abner, my love, I daren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
understand?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll follow us.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
bound to.&nbsp; The police . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good thinking of that,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>She began crying softly, there on the floor above the
prostrate body.&nbsp; Her fingers mechanically stroked
George&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; The action irritated Abner.&nbsp; He
could not look at her.&nbsp; He took a cloth from the table and
mopped the blood that was running into his eyes.&nbsp; He propped
himself up with the table edge, for he was still giddy from
George&rsquo;s blow on his temple.&nbsp; A sudden vision came to
him of another kitchen, another man lying on the floor, another
woman crying.&nbsp; The room swam before him.&nbsp; He steadied
himself and sank down into a chair.&nbsp; The sense of time left
him.&nbsp; He could not be certain where he was or in what period
of his life.&nbsp; <a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
388</span>A shrill singing noise was in his ears.&nbsp; Through
it, distantly, he heard the clear tone of a clock striking eight;
and this recalled him to life, to the room that he had lost in a
blur of confused memories, to the sound of Mary&rsquo;s
sobbing.&nbsp; He remembered that he had been speaking, but could
only repeat the last words that had left an echo in his memory:
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; he heard her ask.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wasting time over this.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re coming
you must come now.&nbsp; Now or never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She neither moved nor answered him.&nbsp; He felt sorry for
her: bent over her, pressed her to him.&nbsp; She turned her face
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t, Abner . . . not now,&rsquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think: I can&rsquo;t
feel.&nbsp; Oh, why didn&rsquo;t he kill me . . . why
didn&rsquo;t he kill me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He would have lifted her to her feet, but she lay a dead
weight in his arms.&nbsp; All power of volition had left
her.&nbsp; She sank back again limply, shaking her head from side
to side.&nbsp; Her hair had become loose.&nbsp; It hung down over
her shoulder.</p>
<p>Abner felt that he must do something to break the paralysing
spell that held them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going, Mary,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t stay.&nbsp; Let me help you up!&nbsp; Come along
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use,
Abner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s naught left for you here that I can
see.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only you and the kids I want to look
after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could only go on sobbing: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use . . .
it&rsquo;s no use!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m no judge.&nbsp; Maybe yo&rsquo;m
right,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>He turned from her and went upstairs to collect a few of his
belongings.&nbsp; On his way down again Gladys came timidly to
the door of Mary&rsquo;s room and called his name.&nbsp; Her
piteous fragility touched him.&nbsp; He took her in his arms and
kissed her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, Abner?&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s mam?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He picked the child up and carried her to her cot, telling her
that she must be a good girl and go to sleep.&nbsp; Morgan was
sitting up with his fingers in his eyes, <a
name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 389</span>crying
mechanically.&nbsp; &lsquo;You look after our Morgan till mam
comes,&rsquo; he told her.</p>
<p>He came down into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary . . .&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She did not answer.&nbsp; He went to her and put his arms
round her neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, lass,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Her sobbing increased, but she would not raise her head.&nbsp;
He wanted to pick her up in his arms as he had picked up Gladys,
to carry her away with him; but he knew it was useless.&nbsp; He
kissed her again, then rose and went to the door, closing it
softly behind him.&nbsp; The cold air revived him.&nbsp; He drew
it gratefully into his lungs.&nbsp; He was conscious of a strange
physical lightening, as though a material load had slipped from
his shoulders.</p>

Twenty-Fifth Chapter</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Behind</span> him Wolfpits lay brooding in
the moonlight on its departed life.&nbsp; He did not turn to look
at it, and in half an hour had reached the main road.&nbsp; He
did not know where he was going, but turned mechanically toward
the east, the quarter from which he had first entered the
hills.&nbsp; At present it was not in him to strike out a way for
himself; he could do no more than retrace his steps.&nbsp; He
walked fast, impelled by an unconscious energy, and all the time
one dominant thought possessed his brain.&nbsp; &lsquo;Curse
women!&nbsp; Curse all women!&nbsp; Curse the bloody lot of
them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He passed through Chapel Green and Mainstone, dead villages
both.&nbsp; Not a light in their windows.&nbsp; As dead as
Wolfpits.&nbsp; The poplar under which he had trysted with Susie
hung above him.&nbsp; The moonlight broke in ripples on its lofty
crown.&nbsp; He saw nothing at all, heard nothing but the steady
rhythm of his feet and the monotonous burden of words in his
brain.&nbsp; The moon sank.&nbsp; Now the road was only faintly
luminous with the reflected pallor of the sky.&nbsp; He heard a
new noise behind him, and the lamps of a motor-car swept a
slanting beam that carried his shadow into the hedge.&nbsp; The
noise of the engine became distinct.&nbsp; A top-heavy van loomed
up above the two blinding eyes of the headlights.&nbsp; He stood
aside to let it pass; but as its roar overtook him, his own voice
gave a hail that was swept along in the draught.&nbsp; He did not
know why he had shouted, but a second later the car pulled up
with grinding brakes, striking sparks of fire from the
road.&nbsp; He ran after it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; the driver called.</p>
<p>It was a man whom Abner had sometimes met at Llandwlas station
when he was driving the milk from The Dyke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Want a lift?&rsquo;&nbsp; Abner caught him up and climbed
into the seat next his.</p>
<p>They set off again, whirling like a tornado through <a
name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 391</span>the
darkness.&nbsp; They could only speak to each other by shouting,
for the engine was old and full of rattles, and the milk-pails
jangled behind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drop you Lesswardine Bridge?&rsquo; the driver
shouted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drop me in hell if you like,&rsquo; Abner replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about Shrewsbury to be going on with?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The roar and vibration filled Abner&rsquo;s aching
brain.&nbsp; They turned northward at Craven Arms and plunged on
between the rising masses of the Mynd and Caer Caradoc.&nbsp; The
hotels of Church Stretton burned like a constellation in the
darkness on their left.&nbsp; The lights of Shrewsbury
appeared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s good going, bain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said
the driver, with a laugh.</p>
<p>He refused the drink that Abner offered him and set him down
in the outskirts of the city.&nbsp; Abner&rsquo;s head was
splitting.&nbsp; He staggered into a pub and drank three double
whiskies straight off.&nbsp; What was there for a man to do but
drink?</p>
<p>He passed into the main streets of the town.&nbsp; After the
silence and darkness of Wolfpits it seemed to him a city of
palaces sparkling with light.&nbsp; He moved in a dazed manner
through the streets; had another drink, and began to feel
better.&nbsp; For the first time since he had set out he felt
capable of a determination.&nbsp; He resolved, as far as his
money would let him, to get drunk.</p>
<p>He sampled several pubs and at last found one to his
fancy.&nbsp; There, in a small and crowded bar, he settled
himself in a corner next the counter and ordered his drinks
methodically.&nbsp; Nobody took much notice of him, for most of
the men who had gathered there were regular customers who came in
every night.&nbsp; The only person with whom he had anything in
common was a lanky labourer with a small head and dark eyes who
sat at a table opposite to him drinking beer.&nbsp; The evening
wore on.&nbsp; Abner was no longer conscious of such
details.&nbsp; The only things that detached themselves from the
warm, rosy confusion were certain points of light, the stopper of
a cut-glass decanter that flashed rays of ruby and emerald-green;
a brooch of brilliants that <a name="page392"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 392</span>the barmaid wore; a medal hanging on
the watch-chain of the labourer opposite to him.&nbsp;
Abner&rsquo;s fancy played with these lights childishly
fascinated.&nbsp; He heard not a word of the conversation that
buzzed around him, keeping only enough of his senses to ask and
pay for his drinks.</p>
<p>It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock when another figure entered
the bar: a man dressed in a military uniform with staring eyes
and a red face that appeared to be transfixed by the skewer of a
waxed moustache.&nbsp; He carried a silver-headed cane under his
arm; his tunic fitted his back like a glove, and in his cap he
wore a raffish bunch of ribbons.&nbsp; He shook hands with the
barmaid, swept the room with a curious glance and settled down
with his drink at the elbow of the lanky labourer.&nbsp; He spoke
so loudly, and with such an accent of gentility that his voice
could be heard above the rumour of the bar.&nbsp; He slapped his
neighbour on the back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of work?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
no need for any one to be out of work in these days.&nbsp; I know
the kind of work you chaps get, and damn me if I can see how you
put up with it.&nbsp; Now, what have you been earning on the
farm?&nbsp; Fifteen shilling a week?&nbsp; I guessed as
much.&nbsp; And ten hours&rsquo; work a day.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a
fine life for a man!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a damned fine life!&nbsp;
I know what it is, my boy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had some of it.&nbsp;
But that was many years ago.&nbsp; I had the sense to join the
army, the good old Fifty-third, and I&rsquo;ve lived the life of
a gentleman ever since.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you ought to
do.&nbsp; Take the King&rsquo;s shilling!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
know what you&rsquo;re missing.&nbsp; Travel?&nbsp; See the
world?&nbsp; I can tell you I&rsquo;ve seen things you
wouldn&rsquo;t credit.&nbsp; India . . . Egypt . . .
Cyprus.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a fine place now.&nbsp; You should see
the women in Cyprus!&nbsp; Hey?&nbsp; Women!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
broke into an obscene laugh.</p>
<p>The last word echoed late in Abner&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Women!&rsquo; he heard himself mumble.&nbsp; &lsquo;Curse
the lot of them!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant turned to him, delighted to have dragged another
person into the conversation.&nbsp; The old hands nudged each
other and smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s going too far, my boy,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You <a name="page393"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 393</span>don&rsquo;t know women till
you&rsquo;ve rolled about the world a bit.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
many a chap that&rsquo;s been disappointed with them in England
that&rsquo;s gone into the army and changed his mind.&nbsp; Now
you&rsquo;re another, like my friend here, that&rsquo;s cut out
for a gentleman&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no saying that
a fine chap like you mightn&rsquo;t go a lot farther than I ever
did.&nbsp; Athletics count a lot in the army.&nbsp; Football,
cricket, and that.&nbsp; Upon my word, it&rsquo;s just like a
long holiday, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; A chap like you
might be an officer before he finished with it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
crossed to Abner, took his arm, and whispered in his ear:
&lsquo;If you went out to Egypt where the second battalion is
now, I could show you some places in Cay-ro as would soon change
your mind about women.&nbsp; God, it&rsquo;s a gentleman&rsquo;s
life, Egypt, with all the blacks to wait on you as if you was a
lord!&nbsp; And whisky twopence a glass in the canteen!&nbsp;
Women!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d learn you about women.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve learned all I want about <i>them</i>,&rsquo;
said Abner sullenly.</p>
<p>But he allowed the sergeant to stand him a drink, and found,
as the time went on, that he was as good a fellow as he had ever
met . . . he and the dark labouring man who sat at their
table.&nbsp; When Abner&rsquo;s money was finished, the sergeant
behaved like a friend to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Money!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s money?&rsquo; he said, and pulled out of his pocket
a handful of silver that fell in a tinkling cascade on the
marble-topped table.&nbsp; They sat and talked.&nbsp; The
sergeant kept the ball rolling, patting Abner on the back and
taking him by the arm with a friendly grip.&nbsp; He passed
through a phase of exaltation into one of contented stupor, in
which his only anxiety was where he should find lodging for the
night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that!&rsquo; said the
sergeant.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see you through, my boy!&nbsp;
You trust me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s just time for
another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, in a flash of brilliant light, the evening passed.&nbsp; A
policeman put in his head at the door and disappeared.&nbsp;
Abner found his new friend helping him to his feet.&nbsp; He
laughed weakly, for he found that he could not stand.</p>
<p><a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
394</span>&lsquo;Steady does it, my boy, steady does it.&nbsp;
You holt on to me and you&rsquo;ll be all right.&nbsp; God,
you&rsquo;re a tidy weight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They passed laughing through an uncomfortably narrow doorway
and out into the road.&nbsp; Street lamps danced before them in
an eddying line.&nbsp; The road had a resilient, velvety feeling,
like no other road that Abner had known.&nbsp; They walked arm in
arm, the three of them.&nbsp; Abner felt himself impelled to stop
suddenly, and take the sergeant into his confidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, kid,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
boozed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Boozed?&nbsp; Not a bit of it!&rsquo; said the
sergeant, with an encouraging slap on the back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, you&rsquo;ll look after me?&rsquo; said Abner
anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You bet I will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a good pal, kid,&rsquo; said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Straight, you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later he threw himself with relief upon a
mattress that was built up of three distinct slabs and pulled a
gray blanket over his eyes to shut out the host of lights that
swam before them.&nbsp; He heard the voices of men buzzing round
him and heavy, regular steps on the stone flags.&nbsp; All he
cared about now was sleep.</p>
<p>He fell into a drugged slumber, haunted by many dreams.&nbsp;
He dreamed of Halesby, of old Mrs Moseley&rsquo;s room and Susan
Wade sitting demurely at the foot of her aunt&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp;
Alice put in her head and called him, telling him that his father
was dead and that she could not do without him.&nbsp; He got up
and followed her with Tiger prancing at his heels.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t abear dogs, Abner,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; All his
old resentment against her rose up in him, and he would have told
her what he thought of her had not Mick Connor appeared at that
moment and shouted his name.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come along wud
you!&rsquo; said Mick, &lsquo;why would you be bothering your
head about the likes of her?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s time we were
looking for a drop in Nagle&rsquo;s Back.&rsquo;&nbsp; They
walked on over twilight fields talking of old times.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Go aisy round the corner,&rsquo; Mick warned him,
&lsquo;for the ould devil of a policeman&rsquo;s got his eye on
us!&rsquo;&nbsp; They went round the edge of the woodland on
tiptoe, and there, sure enough, stood Bastard, with <a
name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>a face as
white as death and a thin stream of blood trickling from his
nose.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s dead said Abner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look at him.&nbsp; Our George killed
him!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it,&rsquo; Mick
replied.&nbsp; And as he spoke Bastard turned and stared at them
with blank eyes.&nbsp; Abner set off running.&nbsp; He knew that
his only chance was to run as hard as he could.&nbsp; He plunged
into a close lane, smelling of elder trees and nettles.&nbsp; Now
he knew where he was!&nbsp; This was the Dark Half-hour, and if
he kept on running he would emerge in safety on the hill-side
above Mawne Colliery, just below the cherry orchard.&nbsp; Even
now he could hear the thudding of hammers at Willises&rsquo;
forge.&nbsp; Bastard was gaining on him, pounding along behind
him, but a man stood in his path and barred the way.&nbsp; At
first he thought it was his father, but a sudden revelation
showed him that it was George Malpas.&nbsp; George Malpas,
deathly white under his prison crop, and armed with a
poker.&nbsp; They closed and struggled.&nbsp; It was a desperate
business, for George managed to keep on battering his head with
the poker, and Mary, in her strange tragic beauty, clutched at
his arm.&nbsp; He knew that he was done for; fell with his hands
locked about George&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; Bastard seized him from
behind, and he woke.</p>
<p>In prison?&nbsp; Surely this could be nothing else.&nbsp; A
long stone room lit by a single gas-jet burning low and
blue.&nbsp; He saw that he was not alone.&nbsp; The whole room
was spread with mattresses, on which were lying figures covered
with gray blankets like his own.&nbsp; His neighbour, a man who
snored heavily and clutched at his hair with his hands, gave a
groan.&nbsp; This could not be a dream.&nbsp; Through the
thudding of hammers in his head his consciousness painfully
emerged.&nbsp; He remembered that he had come to Shrewsbury the
night before, that he had slunk into a pub and drunk
heavily.&nbsp; Where was he now?&nbsp; In a workhouse . . . a
hospital . . . a doss-house . . . a jail?&nbsp; He could not
guess.&nbsp; In any case it hurt his head to think.&nbsp; He
tried to get his bearings.&nbsp; He had gone to bed in his
boots.&nbsp; That was natural enough.&nbsp; He felt for his new
watch.&nbsp; It was not there.&nbsp; He swore under his breath,
not at the unknown people who had stolen it but <a
name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 396</span>at his evil
luck.&nbsp; He supposed that they had stripped him of his money
too&mdash;not that it mattered!&nbsp; He searched his left hand
trouser pocket to see if anything remained.&nbsp; Not a
penny!&nbsp; He laughed to himself.&nbsp; In the other pocket, to
his astonishment, his fingers lighted on a single coin.&nbsp; How
the devil had it got there?&nbsp; He fished it out, then propped
himself on his elbow and held it up in the faint light.&nbsp; It
was a new shilling.&nbsp; He stared at it; then spat on it for
luck.&nbsp; So, tired and wretched beyond words, he turned over
on his side, wrapped the blanket round his head, and went to
sleep.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
